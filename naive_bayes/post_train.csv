post,Class,positive,I am in a class in CoE right now which doesn't require prior programming knowledge clearly on the course requirements. However, the final project in this class is asking us to code in python and we have not been taught anything about python. The instructors don't seem to care much so is there a way I can bring it up with a higher authority?
comment,Class,positive,Python is particularly new programmer friendly, what are they asking you guys to do? I‚Äôve been assigned projects in languages not explicitly taught in the class before.

post,Housing,positive,Is there a demand right now and where do people typically list? Don‚Äôt really know what price to list. Thanks for the help!
comment,Housing,positive,Facebook groups most popular way. I‚Äôm pretty sure most places max out at ~$500 a month per person for summer sublets, way less demand than supply, even for places like Zaragon.
comment,Housing,negative,Summer sublets have so much supply and little demand even without covid so you would need to set a low price but I‚Äôm sure you could salvage some money with a sublease compared to just paying a dead cost.

post,Degree,neutral,I‚Äôm transferring in rn, and I‚Äôll only have micro, calc 1, and stats completed before fall. Is it possible to finish the remaining requirements for the major in four semesters? Or will it be too busy.
comment,Degree,positive,in order to finish the major you would need econ 102 or the equivalent, econ 251 (or the otehr econometrics courses they allow) and then econ 401/402 along with 15 credits of electives and this means most likely 5 (you can do it in 4) classes. Those electives can all be taken in one semester but after econ 401. Econ 401/402 don't NEED to be taken after 101/102 but its strongly recommended. I think you should be fine with four semester to finish. Im not sure what other classes you have to fulfill LSA requirements but keep those in mind  &#x200B;  fall 2021: econometrics (4 cr), econ 102 (4 cr)  WN 2022: econ 401(4cr)  fall 2022: econ 402 (4cr ), electives (3-4)  Wn 2023: any other electives (3-4)
comment,Degree,positive,Super doable. That‚Äôs what I did... actually I didn‚Äôt even have stats... but you could even finish the requirements in 3 semesters

post,Finances,positive,Hi,  I‚Äôve committed to umich and will be a freshman next year in LSA.   I was offered a grant for financial aid, but I‚Äôm planning to commute to school since I live really close to campus. Obviously the grant will be applied to my tuition, but I‚Äôd have extra money left over. I‚Äôm wondering if I could apply the grant money to a meal plan as well even though I‚Äôm not dorming or living on campus?    I‚Äôd appreciate any and all help. Thanks!
comment,Finances,positive,Yes you should be able to. I knew a handful of people who lived off campus in AA but had a meal plan cause they just knew themselves, they wouldn‚Äôt pack a meal and liked the flexibility of locations of dining
comment,Finances,positive,Tbh meal plans are really overpriced and usually aren't worth unless you want to regularly have meals with friends or something. You're better off just keeping the money and eating at any nearby restaurants. You can still pay to get into dining halls when you don't have a meal plan.
comment,Finances,positive,Of course, really anything can be if it's charged to your student account. Your student account holds a balance, scholarships, grants, and financial aid are deposited into this, tuition, (on campus) rent, and meal plans as well as books and parking fees if through the university are charges to this account.  There are some oddities and intricacies, for example if you have a negative balance is actually a good thing cuz it means you overpaid; positive balance means you owe the university money. As well as aid and stuff tends to adjust so you don't get a large "refund" from the university.  Also, you can't just charge random things to it, they have to go through the university so really only direct school expenses can charge that account. You can see the balance on wolverine access.  Or at least that's my understanding of it.

post,Degree,negative,Does anyone have experience in the cogsci major? Specifically the philosophy and cognition track? I‚Äôm stuck between the cogsci major and majoring in Econ.
comment,Degree,positive,Honestly, I feel that the Decision and Cognition track more aligns with Econ, especially since Econ classes count as electives for that track, but you should go for it! I‚Äôm a double-major in Math of Econ and CogSci (Decision-Making), and it‚Äôs been awesome! If you can, double major!
post,Class,positive,Do people receive honors codes for eecs 183. Seems like such an easy intro class with similar code that everyone‚Äôs code is similar. Would this MOSS cheat detector only raise suspicion if the similarity score was about 60%? I‚Äôm just wondering, because me and my friend were looking at out old eecs 183 codes and it was very similar and we were shocked to see that. I‚Äôm in eecs 280 right now, and I am now scared I‚Äôll be wrongly honor coded because someone‚Äôs code is similar to mine
comment,Class,positive,Like you said, there aren‚Äôt that many ways to make your code look different from others in intro classes like 183. Even in 280, I would say your code can be pretty similar, except for your driver functions. That being said, I don‚Äôt think you need to worry about being honor coded, especially if you didn‚Äôt engage in any kind of activity that violates the honor code.
post,Degree,positive,How is math minor at umich? If I am now a DS, will adding a stats major or math minor be beneficial? Any advice? Thanks

post,Finances,negative,I went into UHS a couple weeks ago for some blood work that was sent over to the university‚Äôs hospital. I just got the bill for that lab work and it was a whopping $700. My insurance took out about $500 dollars but it‚Äôs making me question what I‚Äôm paying for for each test. Since I didn‚Äôt go through the hospital directly I shouldn‚Äôt be getting charged for wasting their space or having my blood drawn there. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or negotiating prices to make it cheaper?
comment,Finances,neutral,Did you agree to the results being sent over to the university hospital?   If so, then you *did* utilize the services of the hospital, and that warrants a bill, which is shitty but true.
comment,Finances,positive,If you can't afford it, try asking UHS to write it off. Worth a try. I know they do sometimes.   If they say no, then yeah I'd call and get an itemized list (if you don't already have one) and maybe offer them $50 or something to settle it. Looking up the usual amounts Medicare or Medicaid pays can help you determine roughly a fair price (though those are low prices).   It is also slightly surprising that you've got a bill for $200 for some labs unless you had some major stuff done (and even then). Check your EOB to make sure the amounts your insurance says you have to pay make sense with your plan.

post,New Student,positive,I was wondering if it would be beneficial to me to use the AP credits to skip classes and start with more advanced level classes or just not use the credits to somewhat refresh myself on the material.  The current credits I have are: Bio (5), Psych (5), Phys 1,2 (5), Stats (5), Calc AB (5)  The credits I anticipate to get this year are: Chem, Calc BC, Lit, Lang  I'm kinda worried if I'll get screwed over by the higher level courses if I skip the introductory courses with my AP credits, so any advice is welcome!
comment,New Student,positive,trust me, you want to skip calculus 1-3
comment,New Student,negative,use all your credits, seriously. not using them id a waste of time.
comment,New Student,positive,Never get fooled into retaking an math/science class at Michigan that you could have skipped. Don‚Äôt even think ‚Äúoh I already know the content, I can get an easy A which helps the GPA‚Äù. You might get an A, but it‚Äôll be a ton of work. Just skip it
comment,New Student,positive,One thing to keep in mind is that using your AP credits will make you an upperclassman faster - and your tuition costs will go up accordingly.  Transferring in the AP credits to fulfill specific major requirements is great, but getting general elective credit for them might just end up costing you money.  I transferred in with 26 credits or something, and ended up dropping some from my transcript to save me a semester of upperclassman tuition.  Didn't affect my graduation date.  edit: and as /u/QueenIsTheWorstBand said, the Lit and Lang ones won't do you any good.  I got 5s on both those and still had to take freshman comp :(
comment,New Student,positive,Put 80% of your effort into Calc BC and 20% into Chem. The English ones won‚Äôt do you any good here.
comment,New Student,neutral,If you are in Engineering, take Phys C.
comment,New Student,negative,Skip everything that you can. I haven't heard of a single person who has regretted skipping classes but I have heard of many people regretting repeating classes.
comment,New Student,positive,Is AP credit for physics C worth it (I'm getting my wisdom teeth removed the day before the exam so I'd have to move my appointment, plus the exam is four weeks after school ends so I'd have to study a lot more)? I don't feel that I learned much during physics this year so I was initially planning on just retaking physics in freshman year. Is the intro to physics class at umich extremely difficult? I'll probably be in meche for reference. Thanks so much!!
comment,New Student,positive,This question better be a joke, taking AP classes to skip classes was the best thing I‚Äôve done in high school. That and taking math at community college. Skip as many lower level classes as you can do you can enjoy the great and interesting upper level classes.
post,New Student,positive, Hi there!  I recently got accepted into Michigan‚Äôs School of Information BSI program (UX path) as a transfer student and I‚Äôm extremely excited about it! However, I do have a couple of questions I am hoping current students could give me some insight on!  The first question I have is minors. At my current university, I am a psy and marketing minor, however, I noticed psy isn‚Äôt a minor, and my friends who currently go to Michigan told me I missed the application cut off to apply for a minor at Ross? I‚Äôm currently looking at minoring in art at STAMPS, but I‚Äôm unsure about it. I was wondering if anyone could give me any suggestions on minors that would complement my UX design major.  My second question is if anyone else who has transferred into the BSI program has found time to complete a minor, or if they would recommend I just stick with focusing on my major.  I‚Äôve been talking to my parents about adding a minor and they are extremely worried for me. The current university I go to is barely a top 200 university and they are worried BSI‚Äôs workload will be too much for me to add a minor. I‚Äôm hoping there are a couple of BSI transfers or just BSI students in general that could give me some insight!  Thanks!
comment,New Student,positive,it does not matter where you come from. the bsi rigor will be a joke. add an applied statistics or philosophy minor
comment,New Student,positive,Multidisciplinary Minor can be very useful in gaining UX/UI skills and building a portfolio to be competitive in the job market.   It's whatever you make of it. They have many different projects that can either be research, corporate-sponsored (can help you land an internship), and student org driven.  Penny Stamps offers electives to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Acrobat.   [BSI is 45 credits](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/curriculum). This is not a lot credits when you consider BSI students don't require Foreign Language, area distribution, ULWR that LSA requires.  And the workload is not known to incredibly intensive.
comment,New Student,neutral,CS is probably a good minor. BSI is usually seen as low workload, so low people often double MAJOR.
post,Prospective Student,positive,hey! i‚Äôm looking at michigan and have heard some horror stories of competitive schools having incredibly competitive ECs. is it super hard to get into clubs, research, internships, etc.? thanks for the help :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,For the most part, no, the vast majority of clubs are always encouraging new members to join and you can join whichever clubs you want. However, for business and (maybe CS too) there are some clubs that are competitive. For research, it is all about you reaching out and asking about availability. There's so much research that happens here, I'm sure you'll be able to get involved w/o much difficulty.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The Ross ones are very competitive but the rest of them aren‚Äôt for the most part. But the Ross clubs are also generally the best for professional development so ig it makes sense (coming from an engineer)
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,This'll depend a lot on your field.  Consulting/programming/hacking/build teams/data science/etc. are pretty competitive.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Depends on what major. For CS, I don't think it's hard to get research. As far as I know, clubs don't have cutoffs for membership based on a resume or whatever like Cal does.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm a freshman and I applied to 5 different investing clubs and didn‚Äôt get into any of them. Many of my friends have had the same experience. Don‚Äôt know about other fields but business clubs are definitely super competitive.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey U of M engineering/computer science students, I'd like to hear an estimate on how many hours per week you study (I'm aware this can be variable) and how much free time you have? Would the amount of free time you have be enough to, say, work on a startup?  Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As a BME major I have 4-6 hours of free time a week (not counting 45 minute workouts) but I also work like 12-15 hours a week in a research lab and I‚Äôm in 18 credits so that‚Äôs pretty extreme, last semester it was more like 10-12 hours a week
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Lots of people work on startups, so definitely possible. I personally did one as a student in the CoE. Started it my freshman year. And even with that, I always got my 8 hours of sleep, had a social life, was involved with some clubs, and usually did no school work from Friday evening until Sunday morning.  Friday night and all of Saturday off gave me the time I needed to recharge, detach, get outside, be social, etc.   Now that wasn‚Äôt an ironclad rule, if I had exams or a big project coming up I might lose some sleep or have to work on part of Saturday. But that was the normal week for me. It definitely takes some adjusting to college pace and learning time management, but that‚Äôs normal.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Probably like 10 hours of free time per week as a CS major
comment,Prospective Student,positive,In a typical semester as a CS student, I tend to study about 45-60 hours per week (including transportation, eating, etc.). This essentially leaves me with about 4 hours/day of free time. Typically, I take 4 classes in a semester, 2 of which are "harder" classes (10-25 hours/week each) and 2 of which are "easier" classes (5-10 hours/week).
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,and an add on to the question (as a prospective student) -- how much do you sleep every night?
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,my work is usually done from 10-3pm and I have the rest of the day to do whatever I want
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Considering the amount of time I spend on Solar Car you could probably help out with a startup   Manage one yourself? Probably not   But help? Sure
post,COVID-19,negative,Mostly title. If i want to study with my roomate on campus, to take a break from the same house iv been in every day, why can't we sit together? There have been tons of times where this literally puts one of us closer to someone else which is more of a covid risk. We've tried to explain this to building staff, but told its just the rule.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Because building staff have no good way of verifying that you‚Äôre actually roommates / part of a quarantine bubble.   Building staff members are doing their best.
post,Class,positive,This is a little vent , I‚Äôm currently a junior going to be a senior in the fall semester . Ever since I transferred to UofM I  feel like a failure . My current major is statistics /data science and I‚Äôm struggling so much . I‚Äôve completed most of the classes and only have  4th year upper level statistics classes . I feel like I‚Äôm not smart enough for the classes , when I was in a different school I thought I was good at maths cause I normally did very well in the calculus class and other pre reqs. However , now that I‚Äôm at UofM , everything feels like such a struggle , I keep retaking my classes . I know I have like 35 credits left to graduate , but I honestly just feel so unmotivated and dumb . Any advice would be appreciated.
comment,Class,positive,Hey! This is totally normal!! And it has a name: imposter syndrome. Take a second and recognize that you got into Umich for a reason and you deserve to be here! It‚Äôs okay to struggle, especially this year. Give yourself some grace to not be perfect, and recognize that you‚Äôre trying so hard!
comment,Class,positive,Lol same bro. I came here after being valedictorian and breezing through my AP classes and now I‚Äôm average at best and looking at getting a C in one of my cs classes. It sucks but go blue I guess
comment,Class,positive,Hi. I can help. I know the material in a good number of the classes that you‚Äôre taking. PM me and I‚Äôll happily give you a crash course over zoom for nothing in return.
comment,Class,positive,I think someone else said this in another post but the point is all the students at Michigan were probably at the top of their class in high school or in terms of transfer students, they were high-performing college students at other colleges. Compared to the rest of the population, most people here are probably at the top 10% in terms of academic performance and/or IQ. If you put all the highest academically performing students in one place (Umich), some people will HAVE to be average or below average bc not everyone can be above average. But being average in the top 10% of the entire population doesn't sound too bad if you ask me :) I hope this puts everything in perspective for you. While it sucks to get average grades sometimes, you got to keep in mind that you're competing with the leaders and best. You DO belong here just as much as everyone else. :)
comment,Class,positive,There are a lot of smart people in the university. Although it's difficult to be among the best, you should be able to achieve at least average performance in your classes because there are always people who don't study much due to various reasons. If you are struggling with your classes, you can also talk to the instructor, who may be able to help you better study and prepare for exams. But all this requires motivation. If you have a negative mindset (e.g. I'm failure), it just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Yesterday afternoon I heard a knock on my door. My partner was puttering in the kitchen while listening to music on his headphones, so I answered. Before me stood a cop and two security guards. The first thing I noticed was the gun in the holster, and honestly my heart just sank because this didn't look like good news. They asked if my partner was home and when I asked what's this about they reiterated they could only talk to my partner. So my partner, who was like 2 feet away, comes to the door. Then they inform him that a neighbor filed a report that my partner was stalking the neighbor and asked him if it were true. Both my partner and I were absolutely shocked and looked at each other like we were just struck by lightning. Apparently, my partner was outside in the courtyard in front of our apartment like an hour before this, listening to a podcast and enjoying sunshine. He then went to check the mail, but vaguely noticed that someone was checking their mail so he walked back to wait for that person to leave since he didn't have his mask on. Once the person left, he checked the mail, and went on his happy way around the block.   Apparently this person called the police because a) my partner didn't have a mask on while socially distancing outside b) he thought my partner was stalking him????????  We informed the police that we've been living in our place 3 years, we always practice social distancing and my partner always wears a mask in crowded places where it's impossible to socially distance. And the cop was like, well ok. Then I asked who the neighbor was, and he said he couldn't tell us.   When I asked my partner if he noticed what the neighbor at the mailbox looked like he couldn't even begin to describe this person because he literally didn't look at him.   Like wtf. Been living here for three years. I go and do community testing every week even though I'm never on campus. I follow the rules. I'm friendly to my neighbors. I break down my recycling. And BAM! No apologies. Nothing.   Best part? I get an email from university housing administrator who says she wants to set up a meeting to discuss the incident with my partner regarding the mask mandate on campus.   I am about to graduate and move but damn what a way to go.   TL;DL Some paranoid neighbor called cops on my partner because he didn't recognize him as one of the residents.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,....this is literally so ridiculous I'm sorry you and your partner had to deal with this
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I listened to the recording of DPSS dispatch traffic, and it sounds like the caller was concerned that your partner was apparently watching some kids play in the courtyard. The caller also believed your partner followed them to the mailbox. Sounds like they didn't recognize him or thought he didn't live there. The PD unit left shortly after their arrival after they determined there was no issue.  Sounds like the caller overreacted imo.  I can post the recording if you want.  Edit: Here's the recording. I redacted address/unit numbers. 449 is the housing security unit (two officers). 151 is the university police unit.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/10kZ7Va_NnFM2JqHNAETiUG1hyGisCvPv/view?usp=sharing
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Feels like they wanted to report him for not wearing a mask . I could see a bit why it could be mistaken for stalking if someone is SUPER on edge, but they shouldn't have called the cops on you. I'm really sorry.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Yeah, I've had a similar experience. Feels like that's how a lot of things are headed in the world now, many accusations thrown around all willy nilly are taken too serious even though they're completely irrational and ridiculous.  I'm sorry you have to go through that. It's hard to imagine a person of good mental health thinking someone was stalking them from one encounter. I wouldn't pursue the person, cause then it really could be misconstrued as stalking.  From my experience, even if you genuinely meant good, and didn't do anything, you (or rather your partner), tend to have a bit of anxiety as you don't know what you did wrong and don't want to do whatever it was again. Even though you know you did nothing wrong, it's that what if that sticks to your mind.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Karens everywhere... yeesh.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Shake it off. Cops were called because there might have been a problem. Turns out there wasn‚Äôt one.   Neighbor may have been paranoid. Maybe they have been stalked in the past and are just really worried about it.   The mask thing just makes everyone crazy. It‚Äôs perfectly safe to be outside and unmasked at a good distance. It just starts getting subjective as the distance shortens. Everyone has there own comfort spot. Every community has their own rules and norms. Actual science of the issue probably doesn‚Äôt match up with either.   So, shake it off. Move on. Getting wigged out and angry at the neighbors just amps up the situation.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Glad to hear everyone is okay and everything was sorted out (more or less). Who knows the motivation for calling the police. There were a couple crime alerts last semester up on north campus, that and like others have mentioned, being cooped up this past year has driven everyone a little stir crazy and hypervigilant.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Okay, I'm going to ask the awkward and uncomfortable question: is your partner a member of an ethnic minority? If so, your neighbor might be racist and that might be the reason why they called the cops.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,The overall experience sounds a bit nutty, and I sympathize with you for having to deal with that.  But on an unrelated (I think) side note, I don't get your partner's resistance to the mask mandate. There are very low risk circumstances where the practice is rather unnecessary, but it's so trivial, why not comply? It's absurd the administrator wants a meeting to clarify the rule, because it's so simple, but it seems equally absurd to flout such a simple rule.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,You are very obviously unaware of your rights, are you an American citizen?  Very sad to see.   You should have slammed the door in their face. Instead you went blabbering for seemingly quite a while.

post,New Student,neutral,Hey, I was taking a look at the ULP program and I had some questions.  Is the laptop program only for in state students or is it for everyone?  Also when do freshman usually get emailed about getting a laptop?
comment,New Student,positive,Hello! I‚Äôm an out of student and got one, so I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not exclusive to just in state students. I think I got an email right after I got accepted, so like March-ish? Although the timeline may be different this year with covid. Hope that helps
comment,New Student,positive,Hey! I'm an out of state student and just got one too. I'm a transfer student so I got accepted about 2 weeks ago and got the email about that laptop about a few days ago. Apparently when I was looking at the FAQs, the laptop program is for students with low income and the financial aid office thingy decides who gets it and who doesn't. I could be wrong but that's what I saw. Good luck!

post,Finances,positive,Hey everyone.  I'm a student who transferred from a community college with 60 credits. I was at my previous in-state community college for 3 years (changing majors and working at the same time). I've completed two semesters at Umich so far and both were only made possible due to the Go Blue Guarantee and other grants. Next year I will be a senior, but I'm worried that I won't qualify for aid (either the Go Blue Guarantee or other school grants) because it will technically be my 5th year in school. Anyone have any experience with this situation?
comment,Finances,positive,I was in a similar situation and just now wrapping up my senior year here. Had to retake some classes and forced my graduation timeline back a year. MY FAFSA ran out last semester, but the university found a way to ensure I could afford this semester. You'll be fine, but definitely contact the financial aid office. From one community college transfer to another, I'm proud of you. Go Blue!
comment,Finances,positive,It may vary based on everyone's individual circumstance, but I also was in community college for three years before transferring here. I'm graduating this semester after two years here and I have qualified for Go Blue Guarantee for my entire time here.
comment,Finances,positive,You can check eligibility for financial aid in wolverine access.  You should be fine.  I don't remember where but somewhere in wolverine access it'll say something like  "_____ eligiblity:" followed by credit hours or semesters remaining.

comment,Degree,positive,Long story short: I didn't get into any. Currently on the waitlist for one of them, but realistically there is no chance I'm getting off of it. The economics department is dysfunctional and has been for quite a while now. I took 401 last semester and my Prof. openly talked with us about how they don't have enough professors to satisfy the demand for economics courses. At the same time, they refuse to open up seats for popular classes like ULWR electives that most econ majors rely on in order to graduate and fulfill major requirements. I emailed the dept. asking about whether or not they were planning to open up more ULWR seats and they just told me to join the waitlist. This was extremely annoying considering last semester the dept. head sent an email to all econ students saying that barely anyone drops ULWR courses so don't miss the registration window:  >*For seniors, I strongly recommend registering for  ULWR ECON electives right when¬†your registration starts. If you postpone  your registration, sometimes even for a few hours, you may end up on  the waitlist and you may not be able to take the class at all because  these classes are in high demand and students don't drop them in large  numbers*.  Overall, just extremely frustrated with the current situation. I'm going to be a senior next year and I got into none of the upper-level electives I wanted to take. Wasn't this supposed to get better as your grade level increased? Although I think the registration change is clearly for the better and I support it, it definitely didn't help my registration situation since I lost 8 credit hours. Thankfully I should still be able to graduate on time with my major and minor, but this situation will really be pushing that to its limit. Interested to hear if anyone else is in a similar boat.
comment,Degree,neutral,I just wwent with ENGlish 325. No longer an Econ major, just throwing that option out there.
comment,Degree,positive,There are a couple ULWR Econ 300/400 courses. If you can‚Äôt fit an ULWR course into your schedule, take one of the Econ ones. They‚Äôll count for both your major requirements and the ULWR.
post,Class,positive,If anyone is taking 482 next sem and wants to form a group DM me :) (I'm doing the 6 credit version, not sure if that matters)
comment,Class,positive,You‚Äôll have plenty of time to find partners when class starts btw. But I think the people that respond here might be super eager to start it so maybe they will be good teammates ü§î
post,Miscellaneous,neutral,Hi, is anyone planning on driving down to UIUC or anywhere near Urbana-Champaign after the semester ends willing to give me a ride? I'll pay for gas and other expenses.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Have you considered Amtrak? It's around $70 for a one-way ticket down there, and the train station is close to campus.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I am
post,COVID-19,negative,Many insurances have transportation assistance especially for this situation. They at least had it for Medicaid. Call and ask what your options are!! Worst they can tell you is none.
post,None,neutral,I literally can‚Äôt focus on remote lectures and Covid won‚Äôt exist in the US after June. UofM needs to acknowledge this and go fully in person  Edit: majority of lectures are remote
comment,None,positive,> Covid won‚Äôt exist in the US after June.   Yeah, that‚Äôs some grade A hyperbole right there. Do you have any reliable sources to back that up? lmao
comment,None,neutral,The vast majority are in person. Do some research
comment,None,negative,From a [March 12 article](https://record.umich.edu/articles/fall-plan-to-include-most-classes-in-person-open-residence-halls/) in the *Record*:  >The University of Michigan community will return to campus this fall with **most classes taught in person**, residence halls open at nearly 80 percent capacity, athletic events with fans in the stands, and the campus abuzz with activity.   >   >...   >   >If the levels of vaccination exceed expectations, **the university will adjust as the semester progresses** by further increasing in-person activities and relaxing public health measures.  Many experts think Covid will be around for the foreseeable future, but become considerably less harmful due to immune responses.  Even people who are fully vaccinated get Covid, just less commonly with the current B.1.1.7 lineage variants that are currently dominant in Michigan. They are apt to be more readily infected by equivalent viral load exposure to P.1 or other E484K mutation variants, which flourish in communities with higher immune response rates. These are already accelerating their spread through Washtenaw County, and could become the next dominant variant as vaccination rates continue increasing.  Moderate, severe, and fatal cases of Covid are substantially reduced by current vaccines or prior infection, but not eliminated.
comment,None,neutral,They're not all remote.
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Since there's been a few posts about the new class registration policy, I was just curious about how many semesters people enroll in at Umich. This question just refers to semesters spent at Umich. Spring or Summer 8-week semesters count as 0.5 of a semester. Spring/Summer 16-week semesters are full semesters. If you're a part-time student during a full semester, that counts as 0.5 of a semester.  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/mmw6r2)
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,No option below six semesters for transfer students?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,https://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/factsfigures/gradrates_umaa_05-14.pdf
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,5.5, if all continues to plan.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,5 Semesters
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Six semesters of classes, with one fall taken off to go to Australia with the Solar Car team, so seven total time-wise.
post,Degree,positive,1. I notice a pre req for a math major is completion of one of the sequences ending with math 215-217 or 285-217 or 295-296. I took math 115 first semester, then next semester did 176 but plan to finish up to 285-217. Does this still count because my first class (math 115) wouldn‚Äôt be in the sequence?  2. It said it is strongly recommended for a pure math major to take physics 140-141 and 240-241, but I have not taken nor am planning to take any physics courses. I still need to choose my courses for next semester. Has anybody majored in pure math without taking physics classes?  Edit: 3. I have taken 34 credits so far (just finished first year) and can take a bunch of humanities courses that transfer credits at my local cc during the summer. Is it viable to graduate in 3 years if i continue taking 18 credits per semester, if do a major and a minor?
comment,Degree,positive,You definitely do not need to take any physics classes to get a pure math degree. They recommend it I imagine to hopefully produce more well-rounded grads but those classes are too much work on top of the math classes you'll have to take if you have no interest or other reason to take them.
comment,Degree,positive,1. That's fine! You do need calc I credit, but you have it.  2. No idea, probably not an issue. Highly considering not finishing 200-level physics myself lmao
comment,Degree,positive,The intro sequences are extremely flexible. It's no issue if you mix and match. And taking additional math classes is *never* a problem.
post,Parking,positive,Attention U of M people. I am an incoming freshmen in the class of 2025. I have a serious concern and issue, though.  How can I park my car? I need it to be there for the week basically, but still access at any time.  Another attention: Please do not reply with ‚Äòmost freshmen don‚Äôt bring their cars‚Äô and ‚Äòyou shouldn‚Äôt if you are a freshmen‚Äô and ‚Äòthere are buses.‚Äô I have personal (special circumstances) where I need immediate access to a car if said situation occurs.   Thank you for your help
comment,Parking,positive,Your cheapest (might not be super convenient, but cheap!) is to rent a lot from someone who has a house. Often they're advertised on FB or craigslist or the like. A friend of mine did this and it worked well for her, although it was \~10 minute hike from the dorm to her car. It worked though!
comment,Parking,positive,I would recommend buying a parking spot from an upperclassman with a rental house near campus that comes with a parking spot they don‚Äôt need. You can find those on Craigslist, or sometimes Facebook groups.   Or, if you‚Äôre placed in Bursley or Baits, those dorms have some parking available for residents.
comment,Parking,positive,If you feel more comfortable doing an actual parking pass, the only one available for Freshmen is the Storage Pass.   Only two lots have spots for it, one on North Campus by Baits, and one on South Campus and right by a bus stop to take to campus.  Another commenter mentioned the Bursley/Baits passes, but I think they are only for Sophomores and up.

post,Research,positive,For those who have participated in the SURE program or done research over the summer, what is the workload like? I want to also take some summer classes, but not overwhelm myself. I‚Äôm thinking of EECS 215 at CC and maybe another engineering class, but I‚Äôm not sure if a second class would be overwhelming.
comment,Research,neutral,Which CC? I wanted to do it too over the summer but I couldn‚Äôt find equivalents near to Ann Arbor
comment,Research,positive,What‚Äôs the best way to get to WCC?
comment,Research,positive,For SURE I think they usually want you to work 400 hours over the summer, so like vaguely full-time if you spread it over 10 or so weeks
post,Health / Wellness,neutral,There‚Äôs a walk-in J&J COVID vaccine clinic today and tomorrow at the Meijer on Jackson Road in Scio Township just outside of town! It‚Äôs first come, first serve while supplies last. They start tomorrow at 9am and are still doing shots for today! Just got my vaccine there myself!  Edit: the address is 5645 Jackson Rd, Ann Arbor. It‚Äôs about a 15 minute drive from central campus.  Edit 2: as of ~3:30 Thursday, apparently all the doses for both days have been used up :/
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,They also might have leftover vaccines around 6pm for people who cancelled or didn't show up
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,If this doesn‚Äôt work u can sign up to get one on cvs. They open up appointments at midnight for like 4 days ahead so you could get it within a week. I signed up Tuesday and I‚Äôm getting it Saturday
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Awesome to read this having just finished a 1.5hr drive to the cvs where I managed to snag one lmao
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Just called them, they said tomorrow is canceled because they're already almost out of stock as of now
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thanks to OP, I got mine today. Went in at 1:30 and was done by around 3:15.  Agree with other posts, better to call asking for availability, they told me when I left today that they aren‚Äôt going to have any supplies for tomorrow.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Hometown Pharmacy has had extra doses the past couple days. Number to call is (734) 747-8080
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,update: Just got mine here an hour ago (saw this post so thanks OP), I think they had 30ish left for today as of then and there were around 20 ppl in line when I left. Definitely call them before going cuz that‚Äôs what I did.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Hello everybody. I have 2 questions regarding transfer credit for LSA. (I emailed the LSA transfer office a month ago and still no response).  1. For this summer semester, will online classes that normally wouldn't have been counted for transfer credit before COVID still be transferable as they have been the last few semesters? 2. The LSA transfer guide says to look at the CoE equivalency database for all EECS courses. Does this mean if a course is transferable to the CoE it's also transferable to LSA? I'm looking into transferring in EECS 203 credit because I hear the class is a nightmare here.  Thank you!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,[The answer to the first question is yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/mhz55w/online_summer_community_college_classes/), no idea about the second though.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I‚Äôm an LSA-CS student who transferred credit from a CC for 203 for the same reason. Just make sure to fill out the CoE transfer equivalency form even though you‚Äôre in LSA.  Edit: I wanted to add that I also took that 203 course online last summer and my request was approved even though the database said online versions of the course would not be approved (from pre-COVID).

Am I stupid to turn down a full ride from FSU to go to Michigan (or BU), or are the program, opportunities, and experience worth graduating with some debt? Would the internships and post-grad opportunities be substantial enough to offset the investment? Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,**UofM vs UC San Diego for Political Science**  By US News rankings, UofM is 4 and UCSD is 8. Is that worth an *extra $33K/year*? Did not get any financial aid and have to pay OOS sticker price. UCSD is an in-state school. What are your thoughts?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,intended major: cs or premed   UMich  Pros: t10 for engineering, good atmosphere, i love the campus, have been there a bunch, love the location, good study abroad, basically love everything. also you have two years to declare your major which i really need bc i have no idea what i want to do. got cs in LSA   Cons: expensive. my parents called fin aid office and they gave us some ways to get instate tuition (my parents would have to move there which they are willing to do), after paying a year of oos tuition (which they are also willling to do). but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth 70k/year and moving away from my friends and stuff.   cwru:  Pros: affordable price, good for premed, good atmosphere, very good study abroad (important for me) also more time to declare major. cs in the liberal arts school  Cons: my parents hate this school and don‚Äôt even want to talk about it :/ i think it‚Äôs the best school for the price tho. also cs department is not the best and location is ehhh  UTD:  Pros: i got a full ride, good cs program, good placement in dallas area  cons: bad student life, largely considered a commuter school, doesn‚Äôt really excite me at all, got cs in the engineering school, and hard to switch majors or explore
comment,Prospective Student,positive, Northeastern .vs. UMich  Just wanted your opinion on which college is better for pre-med.  Some factors I was thinking of:  \- 70% of Northeastern pre-med make med school .vs. Umich 58%  \- UMich is ranked higher for STEM/Research (24 .vs. 49)  \- UMich has a med school Northeastern doesn't  \- UMich has way more students tho (small fish in a big pond)  \- both really don't have grade deflation or inflation
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UMich v UIUC v IU Business  I was accepted to Ross and am considering going there over UIUC Gies and IU Kelley. Ross would cost ~30k/yr more than Gies and ~15k/yr more than Kelley for me.  I‚Äôm interested in going down the IB/consulting career path and am wondering if you guys think the cost for Ross is worth it. If not, at what $ difference would it be?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you're not sure where to live if you decide to go to UMich, especially if cost is a consideration for you, I'd definitely recommend at least checking out the housing cooperatives in the area. They have info at [icc.coop](https://icc.coop), and some house tours on their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDgQCg-qPEBQLJWH9NzCg3Q) if you're not sure what that even means.  There's one on north campus by the engineering school, if you're looking at living up there, too.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,how are ap credits taken into account in the college of engineering (i'll come in with about 40 credits from past APs, but what does that mean)?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,questions about premed  Hi! I am deciding between UMICH, Northwestern, Brown and NYU for premed.   UMICH and NYU will be the cheapest but I am curious about how bad the grade deflation is at UMICH. I am considering taking out loans to just go to Northwestern or Brown because they seem to have much more grade inflation and send more kids to medical school. However, I am just wondering how the premed is at UMICH before I make the decision. I am wondering how the classes are, the resources, how good the advising is, and the research opportunities.  Thank you!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Umich vs Georgia Tech for computer engineering. The cost is the same, and I like both Atlanta and Ann Arbor. I‚Äôm wondering which school has better job recruitment and opportunities to intern and work at top tech companies (like FAANG for example).

comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Got into Cornell ILR and UMich (econ major). I want to work with NGOs or do policy research. UMich is 30k cheaper than Cornell. Is there any reason why I shouldn‚Äôt come?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm deciding between UMIch and Purdue for Aerospace Engineering.  Michigan costs 41k and Purdue is 33k (OOS for both). They are both great in AE, but which has the better astro side? Topics I am interested in are aero-thermodynamics, astrodynamics, and propulsion.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UChicago Vs Michigan  I‚Äôm planning to do engineering at Umich, or Economics at UChicago.  Here are some things I like about both schools.  Umich:  * slightly cheaper * good at engineering * much easier than UChicago * I have a lot more credits here * doesnt really have core curriculum (UChicago does)  UChicago:  * good at economics * prestigious * good location * more opportunities  Right now, I‚Äôm leaning towards Umich, but I want to hear your thoughts about this.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UMich vs Upenn for Robotics  Things I've figured out so far:  Finances (if I graduate from UMich in 3 sems the fees are comparable however if I decide to stay back or I am unable to complete the course in 3 sems, UMich has a high tuition fee)  Job prospects: UMich Ann Arbor being close to Detroit has plenty of opportunities. After talking to a couple of people from industries nearby I was able to deduce that industries in Detroit do prefer UMich and other state university students over other universities.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UMich vs. Duke for polisci/econ  I‚Äôm leaning towards Michigan because it‚Äôs cheaper (14k vs 18k so not the biggest difference), a big school, and has great sports, all of which I love. I was wondering if there was any advantage going to Duke in terms of opportunities/prospects within Polisci/Econ? Since Michigan is a bigger school, is there less of a chance to get or even find these opportunities?   Also, have you found large class sizes to be a negative at Michigan?? I like the idea of a bigger school, but was wondering if the small class size at Duke might be more advantageous.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,hey! sorry this isn't completely related to the thread, but I've committed and I was wondering if there are any admitted students chats? the only one I can find is the facebook group that's making you pay... are there any (free) groupme's or discords or anything? thanks :)
post,Social,positive,I don't know if this really counts as a scam, but something I've just noticed is that this group, "Humans of University" is making "official" Facebook groups for University of Michigan Class of \_\_\_\_\_ (which aren't affiliated with the uni) and then saying you have to pay a membership fee of 2.50 a month to join. They don't officially say it but they make it sound all university-affiliated and official. This is what the 2024 [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/michigan2024) says.   **University of Michigan Class of 2024 (Official)**   >Welcome UMich Freshman! Due to increase in membership request, we only accept members that have subscribed now to avoid spam accounts. Please subscribe here in order to join the group:   >   >[https://humansofuniversity.com/umich-facebook-group/](https://humansofuniversity.com/umich-facebook-group/)   >   >This is the hub for first-year life at the university. Feel free to introduce yourself, ask questions about courses, roommates and become friends with each other!   >   >Please note that this group is not affiliated with the university.   >   >For more and accurate information, please refer to the official school website.   This is a fucking scam, and why the fuck aren't people pissed off that this outsider corporation is exploiting incoming students by tricking them into thinking that these are the official uni groups, and making them pay for membership? Like there's not really a rule against making a Facebook group, but I feel like there's something so wrong and backhanded with pretending to be an "official" group for new students to make money of off them.   Honestly, is there any way we can get them taken down? It just seems so backhanded/scammy.
comment,Social,neutral,This is the first I‚Äôm hearing about a subscription fee so I think that‚Äôs new, but for more discussion on this topic go to /r/applyingtocollege and search for David pelling. It was a big conspiracy a few years back. I think the verdict was that humansofuniversity makes all these Facebook groups to sell the members‚Äô data but I‚Äôm not sure
comment,Social,negative,Commercial interests have been making class groups and selling them (or doing more subtle things, but still...things that make them money) for years. It‚Äôs gross.   This sounds even grosser than usual.
comment,Social,positive,I'm not sure what can be done, but maybe contacting the university itself would provide some answers since they're trying to sound affiliated with the university and are clearly doing unethical things with that.  Unfortunately, Facebook and big tech don't really care so not much can be done from that front. Even if they did, their scale makes it difficult to monitor these instances and they wouldn't prioritize it because it's not profitable. Social media is just a huge goldmine for big companies and advertisers to creep on your personal data and make money off of you. It really sucks because there's definitely pressure socially to have social media like Facebook.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I was admitted to the class of 2025 and I applied to Ross but my decision has not come in yet. I have an interest in business and I want to pursue the field. If I don't get into Ross I wanted to know if it would be worth it to attend as an LSA Econ student and do a Ross minor or if I should just not go to Michigan because Ross overshadows everything. (I'm out of state btw)
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,What other options do you currently have?
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Stay in state. The out of state tuition is too high for the added benefit. You will be passed over for Rossholes too. The weather in Gainesville is probably better if you aren‚Äôt used to the cold.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I would transfer to engineering and study IOE if you don't get into Ross. Transferring to engineering is pretty easy and IOE is more respected than Econ from my experiences on campus
comment,Prospective Student,negative,How will you pay for college? If you are setting yourself for a large debt, go to UF. If your parents can pay, and only if your parents can pay, i would say Umich Is better
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Stay in state, nothing at Michigan is worth the crazy out of state cost even if you family can afford it. It‚Äôs like blowing money in a casino. Would not be here if I wasn‚Äôt in state
post,Meme,neutral,
comment,Meme,positive,also umich: you're gonna pay upperclassman tuition BUT you won't get the benefits of BEING an upperclassman :))
comment,Meme,positive,I totally understand the need to level the playing field and allow everyone to register for courses at a fair time, but changing the rules about credits 3 weeks before people start registering is shitty. I brought in an average amount of AP credit, some of which was Calc 1 and 2 equivalent, stuff required for my major that no longer counts.  Also imo the worst part of it is that while those credits don't count towards registration at all, they are still gonna charge upperclassmen tuition for the same credits they just invalidated
comment,Meme,negative,I'm not sure why so many people are so hostile to the other side of this debate. People who had a lot of AP / IB Credits in highschool and were planning on using them to graduate one or two semesters early are being disadvantaged by this decision, and it's okay for them to voice that. There's no reason to impute classism when there is none.  Even people who come from fortunate backgrounds and strongly funded high schools still might have financial problems affording University, and just because they used opportunities available to them that weren't available to others to try and mitigate that financial hardship does not *automatically* make them classist. At the end of the day, unless you're a privileged jerk, both sides were suffering / are suffering at both the old and the new policies, and it's okay for those affected on either side to vent their frustration without diametrically opposing or invalidating the struggles of others. Really our ire should be directed at the institutions that drive classism, not individuals.
comment,Meme,neutral,Unfortunately this *is* a zero-sum game, so to balance out the disparity of AP offerings it‚Äôs kinda necessary.  Worth noting the UCs do it this way already
comment,Meme,positive,I went to a small rural high school that didn‚Äôt offer AP classes, so I really appreciate this change
comment,Meme,positive,Contact your department and the departments of mandatory classes. It doesn‚Äôt always work, but I was able to secure overrides (or have one guaranteed) from my home school (Ford) and my language department in LSA
comment,Meme,negative,I know SOOOOOO many people who get absolutely screwed by scheduling every year because they didn't have APs in high school, meanwhile other students come in with 50 and are always top priority. It is absolutely impossible to catch up from that deficit because they're "two years ahead", but all that meritocracy accomplishes is giving disadvantaged kids an unfair shot at scheduling.  I think those of us in small majors can relate a bit because we have always had to navigate difficult schedules. Sure, our classes may be a lot easier to get into, but if something is offered once a year at one specific time, you bet your ass that you can't consider any other classes during that time slot. And what about the class you really wanted to take but the professor is on sabbatical or teaching something else? Tough shit. You just can't always get what you want, and we have to stop pretending that the AP curriculum is perfect and uniform, or that taking classes like AP Art History, AP Music Theory, and AP Lit should give you higher priority in your Electrical Engineering degree.  I think a lot of people may just need to accept the reality that they won't necessarily get the schedule and the choice of classes they want every time, but it's all in the name of creating a more equitable system. And that definitely won't delay your graduation if you meet with your advisor and get those overrides for your absolutely necessary courses. Sure, you may not get everything you want, but is it worth it if you have to steal it from someone else who deserves it just as much?  P.S. Upper classmen tuition is a scam!!
comment,Meme,positive,yeah but before this situation unfairly fell onto students who had less opportunities in high school, now it's evenly spread based on your credits are a umich student. the school should be working overall to make more sections of popular and commonly required classes more available.
comment,Meme,positive,Pretty lucky that you had all those AP classes offered at your high school.
comment,Meme,positive,Haha true
comment,Meme,positive,School: stops AP and IB credit from counting towards registration priority to allow for fairness for students without access to schools offering AP and IB classes  OP: NOW I CANT REGISTER FOE THE CLASSES I WANT :((((((
comment,Meme,negative,I really don‚Äôt think the University of Michigan would adopt a new policy that is going to send its on-time graduation rates plummeting.  On-time graduation rates depend on a sensible registration priority system (which still exists although in slightly adjusted form),  advising and/or tools so that students can plan out their course progression, and offering enough classes and sections of required courses.  We might consider that perhaps this this policy was NOT primarily about addressing on-time graduation concerns (although maybe I‚Äôm wrong, In which case we‚Äôre now just fighting over who has to graduate late).  What if it was simply about how certain groups of students were getting less-desirable schedules every single term they were enrolled, because they were always among the last in their cohort to register due to this policy?  So they might have graduated on time, but without being able to get the minor that other students earned, or without getting to take electives that other students did, or never getting a top professor, or having to take classes early on Mondays all four years.
comment,Meme,positive,Sorry I'm a prospective student, does this also mean that ap credits can't get you out of classes or is that unrelated?
comment,Meme,positive,First of all the upper level tuition thing sucks.  I get that.  But at the same time I am glad that they are taking steps toward addressing the inequalities in the registration system.  As a student who came in with no extra credits I spent most registration periods registering *days* behind people in my year.  I frequently had to adjust my schedule to fit the classes in that I needed, and even then I often only managed to get one of the last seats.  It wasn't until my final year here that I finally got the schedule I planned for thanks to spring classes that elevated my registration priority.    To put this in perspective, I recently asked my boyfriend (who came in with a bunch of credits and graduated early) if he had these same issues and he looked confused.  For him, getting into a class had never been a problem (pre-med; I realize this varies by program).  Students from rich high schools don't have these issues apparently.  But I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.  After having to fight my high school administration to stop them from cutting advanced courses to save money I have grown used to rural students just accepting the short end of the stick. Why would college be any different?  Long story short, as other people have stated the problem with the new policy isn't registration.  That problem has been plaguing students from disadvantaged school districts for years and you're just beginning to understand the frustration.  The real problem is with the seats available in classes, and until that is solved there is always going to be a group of people that is unhappy.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I was admitted as a pre-admit to the School of Information (so LSA Fall 2021) and I'm interested in the BSI and becoming a UX Designer. How is the program (education, classes, and career prospects wise) and what should I know about applying to it? From what I've seen pre-admits aren't guaranteed to get in  Thanks in advance!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,**Copying and pasting from a comment I made 10 months ago, it's revised to fit your post. According to the director of the program, the acceptance rate is around 35-40%. You are correct, pre-admit does NOT guarantee admission, it only means "interest", which we don't know what that means. Don't get complacent and work hard to differentiate yourself when applying. Here's my old post:**  I am in the UX program as a BSI student with a CS minor. Senior this year, doing the 1-year master's next year.  UX blends in topics of visual design (think illustrator/logo/art), interaction design (actual user experience workflows), psychology (cognitive/social), and communication (when you actually conducting user research in the form of interviewing users, analyzing+aggregating+synthesizing the data you collect, advocating for your designs when working across with other people).  At the end of the day, UX people at real companies can handle a wide variety of actual needs. This can be good or bad for you depending on what you want to do. For example, you might be designing only, doing design and research, designing and coding, etc. The job requirements vary greatly.  As a student studying UX, you have to be hauling ass outside of school. The classes in the School of Information are good and EASY, but they only give you the bare foundations required to start learning. You should be working on side projects, learning about design from online communities, and carving your professional path as soon as you start the program. Solely coasting through the classes will get you nowhere. (Median grade for every SI class is either A- or A), pretty inflated so you can recruit better.  Careers, this is interesting. It really depends on what kind of role fits you, in addition to what you study and prepare for of course. I've been studying design and plan on continuing to study design. For winter recruiting, I successfully recruited for 1 design internship for the winter semester which I did not accept. However, for the past 5 months for summer recruiting, I've been recruiting for design roles with varying levels of success, but earned no final offer in design. Instead, I've had success with product roles- I think my communication skills in conjunction with my design/CS foundation made me realize that product management is a better fit for me.   Please let me know if you have any other questions. Go Blue!
comment,Prospective Student,positive, Multidisciplinary Minor can be very useful in gaining UX/UI skills.  It's whatever you make of it. They have many different projects that can either be research, corporate-sponsored, and student org driven.  Penny Stamps offers electives to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Acrobat.

comment,COVID-19,positive,About a half hour ago, the Meijer Pharmacy at 3145 **Ann Arbor-Saline Rd** had a few appointments available tomorrow afternoon or Friday, which you could book over the phone. J&J vaccine, age 18+, no special occupation/medical condition needed. Identification required, insurance card helpful if you have insurance but not needed if uninsured. Pharmacy number is  734-997-3910, press 0 to talk to a human there. They're open from 8am to 9pm, so only a few more minutes tonight.
comment,COVID-19,positive,i‚Äôm getting mine tomorrow! so happy to see supply finally catching up üòäüôè
comment,COVID-19,positive,Got my Johnson and Johnson one today!! So excited and thankful that Michigan is trying to help us all get vaccinated before the end of school.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Which type?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Me too! Waiting my 15 min now. :)
post,Housing,positive,Hey everyone. I'm an incoming transfer student (will be a junior) in LSA, coming from a different 4-year university, and would really appreciate any insights on the housing process as a transfer student. Is it better to live on campus? If so, where do you recommend, given that I would prefer to live with/around people my age as opposed to freshmen? How can I meet other transfer students? Any advice related to adjusting as a transfer student and / or housing would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
comment,Housing,neutral, we have a discord for transfer students if youre looking to make some transfer friends!! : https://discord.gg/j5bubnt7
comment,Housing,positive,Check out [the coops](https://icc.coop)! I moved into Escher after transferring from Michigan Tech as a sophomore, and it was a really great way to find and build a community, and to live with and be around people but still maintain your independence as opposed to a dorm.
comment,Housing,positive,I am actually worried about housing . Well I just dont want to live on north campus so if anyone has any tips or tricks( I already looked into coops) then I would GREATLY appreciate it. I have been stressing out about not being able to get in a dorm on central so if anyone can help. Please doüòä
post,Class,neutral,Is anybody else a bit nervous about the readjustment to in-person learning? Don't get me wrong, I'm very excited at the prospect of normalcy and I'd much rather have in-person classes as opposed to online, however I feel like I've gotten so used to this format of learning that it might be a bit difficult to readjust the former.
comment,Class,positive,In some twisted way I prefer remote classes over in-person. Granted, I'm in CS so everything was already done on a computer for the most part, but I used to lose so much time to transportation to and from classes. Plus, I work significantly more efficiently at my own desk with a proper mouse, monitor, etc. I know a lot of people have been having a really hard time during all of this, but I do hope my classes next semester at least have the option to do things remotely.
comment,Class,positive,Honestly my biggest concern is the professors who will inevitably stop doing open-note exams. It‚Äôs just always felt unrealistic to me to cram so much information into a few short months and expect us to memorize it in great detail. Especially when some profs give us incredibly vague study guides or none at all.   Like, simply telling us ‚Äújust look over everything‚Äù doesn‚Äôt usually cut it for me, when I don‚Äôt know how much detail to memorize it in or which bits will be assessed more than others. I even had one prof pre-pandemic dedicate a section of the syllabus to exam prep, only to write a single sentence there: ‚Äúread it, and think about it!‚Äù Felt almost like I was being mocked lmao
comment,Class,positive,yeah i feel that, also i think something undervalued was how most tests were open note online and now a lot more time has to be spent remembering minor details for in person exams
comment,Class,negative,I‚Äôm very worried. Mostly about my attention span. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm going to think hard for more than 15 minutes at a time.
comment,Class,positive,As long as you remember to wear pants, you should be fine
comment,Class,positive,I like the way that lectures can be recorded.
comment,Class,positive,I will definitely miss the 2x speed button...
comment,Class,negative,I'm a lot nervous about readjusting to in-person life in general. My social anxiety has worsened since the start of the pandemic. I definitely need to gradually re-acclimate to seeing and talking to people in real time once campus opens up.
comment,Class,negative,I‚Äôm excited, especially since my first year as a graduate student has been spent all online. However, I am really worried if my social anxiety I‚Äôve been working on for years is going to ruin a lot of things for me. I am really anxious thinking about in person presentations the most though. I still shake giving a presentation over Zoom, can‚Äôt imagine how its going to be in front of all my peers I finally meet for the first time :/
comment,Class,neutral,Not to be crass but honestly not at all. The only things I‚Äôm not looking forward are having to wake up a bit earlier to allow for travel time and having to go back to closed note exams.  But overall this semester has been absolutely awful for me academically and personally so the main thing I‚Äôm nervous about is the potential of having to do online classes again.
comment,Class,negative,I‚Äôm just so anxious about sneezing in classes tbh. The thought of being looked at with fear terrifies me.
comment,Class,negative,Hi!  To be totally honest, I'm scared out of my mind. I have severe social anxiety disorder and now even going to the grocery store with a minimal to normal amount of people is enough to trigger a panic attack.  I'm struggling to keep up with my workload now but if I'm being honest I think not seeing anybody for a year and a half is going to make the prospect of being back in person so much harder. I've also come to learn over quarantine that I'm likely neurodivergent (haven't been diagnosed yet due to specialists being closed but I'm seeing a psychiatric nurse who's put me on adderral, which seems to be helping so far), so it's possible that having a routine again will help with the anxiety a bit.  But still. Definitely nervous.
comment,Class,negative,Honestly, I see your point, but online is really burning me out.  In person is difficult on a different level, but at least I‚Äôll have the motivation and study spots to continue.
comment,Class,positive,I don‚Äôt know why but I still feel like the classes wouldn‚Äôt be in person :( it makes me sad . I hope they are but I keep feeling that it won‚Äôt happen :/
comment,Class,positive,I don't think I ever adjusted to online LMAO
comment,Class,negative,I‚Äôm very nervous about in-person learning. I‚Äôm eager to get back, simply for history lectures where I can make pop culture references again but I wouldn‚Äôt be averse to another online semester. 2020-now has sucked, 21 more so for me so in person is anxiety inducing.
post,Event,positive,What was the photo opportunity event like? Just curious because I have mine next week.
comment,Event,positive,You can‚Äôt bring bags in The professional photographers are under tents and you do 2 photos worth them The rest of it is like maybe 10 different backgrounds spread around the field and you have free reign to photograph with them for the time slot you have ( I think they‚Äôre 30 minutes ?)
comment,Event,positive,A point was made in one of the emails to distance in the stadium under all conditions, so I didn't end up signing up for the same time with my friends.  It's a shame because it wasn't really enforced. People were even in groups of like 10 taking maskless photos together. I overheard they share a household together so I don't blame 'em. It's moreso that I just missed out on looking like I have friends.  E: A timer starts at like 2:00 minutes left so you know when to start panicking, handy.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi everyone,  I was accepted to UMich and UCLA's engineering schools and am trying to pick between the two. I'm not sure what I want to go into yet (considering EE, Mech E, comp e, and CS.  I think that UMich's engineering program is a bit stronger than UCLA's, but I do not want to be in the south/midwest after graduating. I would like to be on the west or maybe east coast, preferably in an urban area. I think that attending UCLA would be better in this regard because of its location. I  s it easy/common for UMich engineering grads to go somewhere like Silicon Valley/nyc or do they tend to stay in the area? I'm sure that a good amount of UMich engineering grads leave, but I'm just trying to see if UCLA is worth the advantage in location. If I would get better opportunities location-wise at UCLA, do you think that attending it's worth the difference in engineering program quality from UMich?  I would really appreciate any insight (cost is not a factor).
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Obligatory ‚Äúthis is my experience not everyone‚Äôs‚Äù statement.  I graduated CS-Eng from Michigan, and ime most people who graduate from Michigan tend to move to NYC or Chicago, with most CS grads going to Silicon Valley, NYC, or Chi. Not sure where you heard the south but very few UM grads ime move south unless it‚Äôs Miami or LA.   That being said, both schools are great and you should factor in more than where you want to be when you graduate into your decision. At which will you feel more at home? Which one do you see yourself at more? Etc.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,For your location concern, I doubt everyone stays in the same location as their college after graduation. Most of the CS guys I know go to SV. I'm actually from SV too
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You should be able to get jobs elsewhere after graduation whichever school you attend.  If you may want to work in CA after college though, and are unlikely to work in MI, it would be nice to be nearer to people you knew in school on the west coast.  Both are well respected schools, and the differences in what you get out of your undergrad education may be more dependent on you than the school.  Weather is nicer in LA than Ann Arbor, but cold winters may encourage you to stay productively focused indoors.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,In terms of job prospects it won't matter too much. They are peer schools. Go to ucla since it has the other things you want
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Most umich grads don‚Äôt really stay in the Midwest at all-especially CS, business, and engineering majors. UM has a very large alumni network and you‚Äôre bound to find an alum almost anywhere you go. In the end, they are pretty similar schools so you can‚Äôt really make a wrong choice. I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about the whole ~finding a job on the west coast~ thing. Most top engineering schools aren‚Äôt on the west coast but companies still fly out to them to recruit. Good luck and Go Blue!
post,Sports,positive,Do seating groups matter for football tickets? Like If I join my greek life org seating group but want to go to a few games and sit with my other friends not in the same group as me is that ok?
comment,Sports,neutral,Your seats don‚Äôt matter. You can show up and sit wherever. Unless you‚Äôre in the like bottom 10 or so rows then they enforce. Otherwise they don‚Äôt really stop you. You just have to go in whatever tunnel that your ticket says
post,Student Organization,positive,Is it possible to dorm w someone who's not in wise ? Or CHOOSE ur WISE roommate
comment,Student Organization,negative,No, you cannot request a roommate who is not in WISE. This is true for any MLC.   Some MLCs accept roommate requests and others do not. I don‚Äôt know WISE‚Äôs current policy. But if you don‚Äôt already know someone, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about finding someone online - you‚Äôll already have being a woman in STEM in common.
post,Meme,neutral,They both are all about edge cases
comment,Meme,neutral,oop OH queue :(
comment,Meme,negative,Damn yous.
comment,Meme,neutral,Sad but true
post,Miscellaneous,neutral,No complaints, it‚Äôs just incredibly long and I was curious
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Not sure why the decision was made, but I always appreciated it. I was usually able to do a week or two at home on each end of a 12 week internship. I also knew people that worked even longer at their internships/summer jobs, which was nice for putting extra money in the bank.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I've always heard since 2013 "it's to help students be more competitive with internships that have different start times and gives time to see family or do non-work things"  Despite short winter break between fall/winter semesters, long summer is generally really good imo. Your time off is largely in better weather which makes it easier to travel, and for me, easier to enjoy the time off not in a day with little sunlight.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Not sure, but SP/SU term is roughly the same length as the FA and WN terms, so it's effectively splitting the year in thirds. May have to do with research and stuff
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,[Last year I wrote up this post with some detail on how UM arrived at the calendar it currently has.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/dcq0cw/throwback_thursday_1938_to_1948_academic_calendar/) It was a graduate shift over the course of several decades. In the 1940s the school year was 40% longer. By the late 60s/early 70s we arrived at a calendar pretty similar to what we have now. A lot of it had to do with the shrinking of winter break. Pasting below some of the more relevant stuff I uncovered.    The takeaway here is that the school year used to be LONG. Right now the year is about 140 school days, in the 1940s it was just over 200. Some other things worth noting:  * Classes didn't start until late September, as a result the first semester didn't end until early/mid February.  * Winter break was a similar length as it is today. * Because the semesters ran until February there was no break between first and second semester.  * There was just one summer session which ended well before the next semester started.  I went and found calendars from the decades following to try and figure out when a change was made. It was relatively gradual. In the 1950s there was a slow shift towards an earlier fall start and by the 1960s the fall term ended before Christmas. There was still a much more extensive winter break so the school year didn't end until late May. This gradually changed over the next few years to become closer to the calendar used now.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I think it‚Äôs great to have a long summer. I‚Äôve personally gotten a chance to travel internationally and do an internship in the same summer (pre-pandemic). It goes along with Michigan‚Äôs work hard- play hard mentality too
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Side note, I stayed in A2 the summer between junior and senior year, working and grinding out my thesis. It was glorious. Beautiful weather and a more laid back campus made it a whole different experience. Highly recommend staying a summer if you can swing it.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,funny thing is that a professor told me this year was longer than usual.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,To give grad students longer uninterrupted periods of time to slave away. /s
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Because we have intense semesters
post,Degree,negative,I read that doing Computer Science through LSA does not yield a degree which mentions Computer Science... Is this true?! I am worried sick!
comment,Degree,positive,I'm going to be honest, you're panicking over absolutely nothing and you need to relax a little.  Yes, your diploma will just say "Bachelors of Science". No, nobody cares about this.  I did computer science through LSA. I was never once questioned on this or looked down upon for it. Ended up with a good job too. The only differences are the different prerequisites (engineering needs more math and physics, LSA needs more languages and distribtions).  If you care that much, just take the physics and math classes. Nothing is stopping you, an LSA student, from doing that. Most LSA CS students end up taking linear algebra and such anyway (though I did not).  Seriously, best advice I can give you is relax
comment,Degree,positive,This reads like a troll post...until I checked OP‚Äôs history
comment,Degree,positive,I'm not sure I understand. LSA grants a degree called "BS Computer Science" for majors in Computer Science
comment,Degree,negative,You are worrying about the wrong things
comment,Degree,positive,lmao they‚Äôll know you have computer science skills with a tech interview and a resume my dude
comment,Degree,positive,Please use the search bar
comment,Degree,negative,Any employer who asks for your major / sees your major on your resume will know you majored in Computer Science. For getting a job, it doesn't matter what the exact wording of your diploma is (the diploma is just proof you graduated from U-M).  The exact differences between LSA and Eng for CS are small differences in core requirements for being in LSA vs. being in the College of Engineering, but the CS curriculum is the same for both, and you will get a CS degree either way, and still be employed as a CS major.  No need to worry!
comment,Degree,neutral,[411 students graduated through LSA-CS last year](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-lsa/cs-lsa-enrollment-and-graduation-data/). If they were having problems with getting a job because companies didn't believe they did a CS program, I'm sure there would be some amount of ruckus made.
comment,Degree,neutral,The only difference in your diploma for LSA vs Eng is that you get a B.S. (Bachelor's of Science) in CS through LSA, and a B.S.E (Bachelor's of Science in Engineering) in CS through Eng
post,Degree,positive,hi, I recently declared a second major (both my majors are through LSA) but my plans have changed and I want to switch out of it. i've tried looking it up but all it gives me are "how to declare your major" articles lol.  how would I go about this? do i have to meet with my LSA advisor or specifically a major advisor? thanks :)
comment,Degree,negative,Usually just email the advisor for that department and tell them you want to drop the major. In the before times there might have been a form you have to fill out, probably can just do it all over email now.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I was offered admission back in January, but never received a financial aid package because I had to submit the noncustodial parent waiver. I finally got that appeal approved almost three weeks ago, but still haven‚Äôt heard back about financial aid since then. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone who was in a similar situation knows the time line on that kind of thing because it‚Äôs getting close to the deadline to commit and I really like UMich, but I‚Äôm definitely not committing without seeing the kind of financial aid I‚Äôd get.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Contact the Office of Financial Aid and ask them if they have an estimate for when your aid package will be available.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I had a similar situation. I had to submit the noncustodial parent waiver and it got accepted. After I received my decision, my aid package was given within 48 hrs. You definitely should call or email. I had good communication through email with the financial aid office and they usually responded within a few days. Also make sure to check your award summary through wolverine access. You have to make a friend account in order to access it.
post,Housing,neutral,Would you guys say it's really hard to get into a dorm as a junior, specifically Northwood?
comment,Housing,positive,I lived in NW3 during my senior year, actually! In my experience it‚Äôs usually the last dorm to fill up, mainly bc it‚Äôs on North and doesn‚Äôt come with a meal plan.  I really liked it though, it‚Äôs cheap to have a single dorm there and you have your own kitchen and bathroom! Plus it‚Äôs nice and quiet up there, which is nice for getting work done
comment,Housing,positive,I lived in NW3 as a junior, pretty easily. Depending on how your lottery goes you may not get something very close to Hubbard/Murfin if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, I was in the one closest to Plymouth, but that isn‚Äôt all bad. For what it‚Äôs worth I really enjoyed living there, but I don‚Äôt regret moving over to Courtyards where I am now.
comment,Housing,positive,northwood i believe is meant more for upper level students so it may not be too hard, but i‚Äôd recommend checking out Escher Co-op which is nearby northwood thats a bit cheaper and also a school year lease too (Aug 28-May 1 ish, optional summer term)
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôm pretty sure Northwood III isn‚Äôt available this year?
post,PSA,positive,Email from Dr. Schlissel:      \-------------------------------------------------  Dear Students:  GREAT NEWS!!!   We are pleased to announce opportunities for you to receive a COVID-19 vaccine next week, and we strongly encourage you to [make an appointment](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine)  as soon as possible. Getting vaccinated will keep you healthy, help us  all get back to the activities we love, and reduce our need for as many  public health measures in time for the fall semester. Imagine a semester  with the freedom to hold in-person meetings or events, or even attend  games in the Big House.   A  total of 7,500 doses of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine will  be available to our students at no cost to you through two new sources.  Vaccination is completely free. We sought out supply of this vaccine  because it‚Äôs the best option for many of you as the semester winds down,  as *only one shot* is needed. One and done. Other vaccines require a second dose in 3 or 4 weeks.  The  Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine is highly effective at preventing  severe illness from COVID-19. There is also accumulating evidence that  vaccination prevents infection and transmission of COVID-19 to others.  It has already been administered to nearly 4 million people and is very  safe. This vaccine is only authorized for those 18 years old and above.  All shots will be given by appointment only, and registration is  required.   You  should get vaccinated even if you‚Äôve had COVID-19 diagnosed in the past  unless you‚Äôre within 10 days of having had active COVID-19.   Full details about how to sign up now for a vaccine are on our [Campus Maize and Blueprint vaccine page](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine).   We  know that it is both confusing and a hassle to have to check multiple  places to try to get a vaccine appointment, but our goal is to help as  many of you get shots in your arms as possible before the semester ends.  While you can register at multiple places, please do not make  appointments at more than one place. If for any reason you cannot attend  your appointment, please cancel your appointment so a fellow Wolverine  can get vaccinated.   **Vaccination clinics run by Michigan Medicine on our campuses**  The  University of Michigan has been working with the state of Michigan to  receive 5,500 doses of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine for U-M  students.   We‚Äôll  administer shots to students at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor and in  pop-up clinics at UM-Dearborn and UM-Flint. These will take place next  week. The state has promised us additional vaccine in the coming weeks  if they receive adequate supply from the federal government.   Invitations will be issued via our [Blue Queue](https://record.umich.edu/articles/how-to-sign-up-for-blue-queue/)  system. If you‚Äôre among the thousands of U-M students who have already  completed the full registration process and expressed interest in  getting a vaccine, you‚Äôre already eligible to be invited. Please check  your MyUofMHealth.org account for more information and watch your email  for an invitation from [donotreply@med.umich.edu](mailto:donotreply@med.umich.edu). We‚Äôll send invitations in waves to randomly selected students beginning as early as tomorrow until all spots are full.  If you have not yet completed the Blue Queue questionnaire or would like to update your vaccination interest, please visit [here](https://umichumhs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8oywy6UbWKIkx4p).  **Meijer Pharmacy**  U-M  also has partnered with Meijer, which will provide 2,000 total doses of  the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine on April 15 and 16 at the  Meijer Pharmacy located at 3145 Ann Arbor-Saline Road in Ann Arbor.   Text GoBlue to 75049 or visit [clinic.meijer.com/register/CL0064](https://clinic.meijer.com/register/CL0064) to begin the Meijer registration process right away and schedule an appointment.   **Additional opportunities**  &#x200B;  * We‚Äôre  continuing to seek additional vaccine supply from different sources for  students, faculty and staff. Please continue to check our [vaccine page](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine)  for updates. For instance, we worked with Kroger to administer 1,000  doses to students earlier this week from the chain‚Äôs supply of the  Pfizer vaccine.     * We encourage all students to seek vaccination appointments from all sources. Michigan Medicine has posted tools to help¬†[find vaccines in your area](https://www.uofmhealth.org/coronavirus/finding-vaccines). University Human Resources has created a¬†[COVID-19 vaccine eligibility and availability page](https://hr.umich.edu/benefits-wellness/health-well-being/prescription-drug-plan/vaccines-tobacco-cessation#covid-19-vaccine)¬†with  resources to help everyone get an appointment through a clinic,  pharmacy, health department or Michigan Medicine. The Campus Maize and  Blueprint‚Äôs¬†[vaccine site](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine/)¬†has information, as well. Washtenaw County is opening appointments based on the new eligibility guidelines.  Thank  you for your commitment to the health of our community. We know that  this is a very busy time for our students, and we appreciate your  willingness to seize this opportunity to be vaccinated and help us all  enjoy more gatherings and in-person activities in the months ahead.

comment,PSA,neutral,I leave town one time in 4 months and *that's* when they open up the Big House vaccinations... :|
comment,PSA,negative,WARNING  Meijer is having an issue and cant register appointments for us rn, theyre taking names and will call back when they can.
comment,PSA,positive,I'm curious how fast these will fill up, especially the opportunity at the stadium.
comment,PSA,negative,Just fyi cause the Johnson&Johnson vaccine has the lowest efficacy rate but the vaccine efficacy rates are actually a bit misleading. The trials for different vaccines were conducted in different environments and at different times during the pandemic, so you can't really compare them. Vox talks about it in detail here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A)
comment,PSA,positive,I made an account on My UofM Health and literally can't log in with it, anyone else experiencing this?  I've hit the max number of login attempts and when I try to change my password it tells me any password I give it isn't valid lol
comment,PSA,positive,It‚Äôs pretty easy, especially if you have a car, to get an appointment at pharmacies these days too. Sometimes you might have to drive a bit, but just search different areas on Walgreens, Kroger, Rite Aid, and CVS and if you try for a few days you‚Äôll all but certainly find something.
comment,PSA,positive,That's great news but relax with the exclamation points. Geez.

post,COVID-19,positive,I have a vaccine appointment but found Uber wants $116 one wa and I simply don't have that money. Uber isn't offering any option to not pay this.  If anyone with their own car is going, I can pay for gas . Yeah just, I need a way to get to and fro,  &#x200B;  Thank you!
comment,COVID-19,positive,If you can‚Äôt find anyone, you may be able to take Amtrak from Ann Arbor to Detroit.   From there, I‚Äôm not sure if there are public transit options, or if you could just get a cheaper Uber (it‚Äôs only an 8 minute drive between Ford Field and the Detroit Amtrak Station).
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Is Lyft available? They're usually cheaper than Uber
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Would Zipcar be an option? https://www.zipcar.com/universities/university-of-michigan
comment,COVID-19,positive,There‚Äôs a few bus options but your going to need a lot of time    https://goo.gl/maps/YfJcNW5X92B7UHP1A
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Remember we're only three days into everyone being eligible. Uofm just posted something about appointments for students that someone posted earlier today.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi! I'm a hs senior who was luckily admitted into Ross and michigan and was wondering if any curremt students could tell me about their likes and dislikes regarding the undergrad program. If anyone is also an oos student and could speak to whether or not the tuition is worth it, that'd be great
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Whether or not tuition is worth it depends a lot on:  1) What is your next best option? How much does that cost?  2) How will you be paying for school? (Loans? Family paying? If the latter, is that money only on offer for undergrad or would they give it to you for grad school, a down payment on a home after graduation, etc.?)
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Go to unc
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I keep posting the same message and I may seem like I‚Äôm trashing michigan but nothing here is worth the oos cost. Wouldn‚Äôt consider Michigan for even a second if I was oos. If I was you I‚Äôd take whatever you have in state and save yourself the money or save your parents the money
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If how much you are paying, in total for all 4 years is MORE than the salary you'll make in your first year of the average job listing of the career you want, it's not worth it.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm thinking about whether or not to apply for a learning community in the fall, and I'd like some perspective on what it's really like to be part of a learning community. I went to an info session about learning communities earlier, and it was overwhelmingly positive, but I'm not sure if that was because it was an info session for it. I'd like to hear from people who aren't a learning community as well as a more realistic opinion from people who are in one. What are some advantages/disadvantages or pros/cons?  For context, I am a girl planning on studying mechanical engineering, but I'm also really passionate about art and I think I want to go into automotive design. I'm considering Living ArtsEngine first and then either WISE RP or MRADS and I'd love to hear about those specific learning communities as well.  Thanks in advance :)  Edit: After some more research, I‚Äôm actually really  interested in Lloyd Scholars too so if anyone has any insight on that, I‚Äôd love to hear about that too!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was part of Living Arts this year. Despite the unprecedented first-year college student experience due to COVID, I still had one of the best experiences in my life through the program. We are an extremely accepting social group, and we really celebrate each other's uniqueness in what they do, be that arts, engineering, music, etc.   So despite having a unideal experience compared to to other freshman LAE classes, I've decided to return as a peer mentor next year.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was in MRADS not too long ago. Keep in mind that this just my experience- I'm sure other people can elaborate on theirs to give you a wider view.  Advantages:  -Living in Mojo, a pretty good freshman dorm, especially compared to Markley. It has a good dining hall and great study areas if you don't want to study in your room all the time.  -Access to research projects & networking (though this could be done through UROP). MRADS gives you access to tons of research projects, which can give you a jump start on research experience. Also, presenting your work at the end of the year is kind of fun (they had good food too).  -Meeting other freshman who are interested in research. This one I personally did not really feel (which I'll elaborate below), but I know some people who made a decent number of friends. And it's always nice to live with people who are in the same program as you, they know the struggle.    Disadvantages:  -MRADS peer mentors/advisors are hit or miss. My peer mentor didn't care about his group at all and mostly became a peer mentor so he could live with his friends. Advisor wasn't bad, but we just didn't click. They did provide good resume advice and email writing advice, but that was about it.  -There are mandatory events/classes you have to go to, most of which are boring. Some do have food where you can chill and talk to people, but the ALA class was super boring and not useful.  -It can be hard to make friends within the community. Everyone has their own schedule and interests so it can be hard to meet up with people at events. Also, it might've just been my cohort, but people didn't really go out if their way to meet new people. Small 4-5 groups of friends formed and it was kind of hard to get into that circle. The only close friend I made during MRADS and was my roommate. If you're outgoing, you'll probably have better luck.    As you can probably tell, I didn't have as great of an experience as I hoped. Though, I would still recommend going into a learning community because you'll get a better place to live and better access to research opportunities. There is potential to make friends, but you'll probably have better luck finding them in clubs or classes.   This was just my experience though, I know some people who loved MRADS and some who didn't. Ultimately, it's what you make of it. I'm not sure if the other learning communities were like this, or if other people have similar experiences, so hopefully someone can tell you about theirs.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Living Arts has some upcoming question and answer sessions:  https://www.facebook.com/207312839565/posts/10158908345679566/?d=n  https://www.instagram.com/p/CNBMXrPl5wP/?igshid=1ffijl6zwgnt5
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hey going to be a Living Arts peer mentor for the next year and also an engineer,  Some of the benefits of our community are:  * We are really social, and are very focused on bonding and making friends with unique interests. Even throughout covid we have been doing weekly socially distanced hikes, walks to get bubble tea together, virtual game nights, and studio ghibli movie nights * We are located in Bursley on North Campus which a lot of us really enjoy because it is quieter and close to nature (we have multiple groundhogs that are our unofficial mascots) * We get funding to do cool projects like make dice out of resin, or a geodesic dome out of paper. Some of these things you are \*required\* to do as a part of the community engagement, but there is such a broad range of stuff you can choose from that all of it is really fun and you are bound to find something you enjoy * We have access to the creative suite, which is basically a living arts dedicated lounge and maker space/tools * You can meet a really diverse group of people that are all interested in different technical creative things, we have a lot of friends that are in STAMPS (the art school) but have been learning how to code, or a lot of engineers that are really interested in drawing and music (and just people interest in everything)  Requirements of the community  * Monthly meetings that last an hour, you get to hear some guest speakers talk about some cool creative thing, and while they aren‚Äôt great they aren‚Äôt bad and everyone goes to them together * Workshops lead by peer mentors. You have to go to at least two a semester, they are a couple hours long, but there are so many fun and cool things available to do for them that me and most of my friends have well exceeded the minimum requirement. Examples of some we had this year (dice making, friendship bracelet making, basic and advanced arduino, resin dice making, recorder workshop, raspberry pi, origami, intro to drawing, etc) * Creative collaborative project (CCP), its a project in which people in LAE from different disciplines get together and are given funding to make whatever they want based on a given prompt, these are presented at the end of the year * UARTS 150 is the only required course for LAE, freshmen take it their first semester. (I think most of the other communities have multiple classes) It is pretty cool, you get to make a video game, and it is generally a good bonding experience as everyone in LAE takes it in one section together at the same time. (If you were not in engineering it would count for the first year writing requirement)  As the other person said, we‚Äôre doing an info session on Sunday at 8pm. Please feel free to stop by if you have any questions.  Here's the link for the session: https://umich.zoom.us/j/92320947913
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I did MRADS and had friends who were in WISE and I cannot recommend them more. Seriously, it‚Äôs such an easy way to make friends/ friend groups from the start since you‚Äôre basically doing similar things and living with ~100 other freshman in the same situation as you. On top of that, both are in Mojo witch is arguably one of the best dorms on campus. The research aspect of the community really is a great way to get first exposure to academia and some really interesting work, too.  Living Arts is located up on north campus. Even though you‚Äôre in engineering I think most of your classes will still be on central freshman year, so I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend it.   Another community that‚Äôs artsy is the Lloyd Scholars, located in Alice Lloyd next to mojo, so it has a great location. I‚Äôve known people who were really involved and loved the community.
post,Degree,positive,Hello everyone,   I‚Äôm an incoming student into LSA and I‚Äôm planning on majoring in economics. I‚Äôm looking for examples of paths I could take in terms of classes for next year but I cannot seem to find anything on the LSA website. Does anyone have any links to resources for this? Additionally, if you are an Econ major, can you tell me what classes you took your freshman year?   Also, career wise, I‚Äôm looking to break into finance. Would you recommend taking some business electives my first year or should I stick to the prerequisites? How many classes would you recommend taking to get acclimated to college? I would also appreciate tips from anyone who is familiar with networking/recruiting for LSA economics Students looking to break into finance.   I‚Äôm sorry for the abundance of questions, I‚Äôm very nervous and excited about attending Michigan and my parents are immigrants who went to college in a different country so I do not have many resources to give me information about this.   If you took the time to read this, thank you so much! I hope you have a great day and Go Blue!
comment,Degree,positive,If you search(google) LSA Econ major requirement, you‚Äôll find out classes that you need to take. Michigan does not have such semester-by-semester plan, though most other universities do.   Questions to ask yourself, what is your goal? Finding a job? Going to grad school? No matter how, Soothe out yourself and do enjoy the summer. You‚Äôd meet an adviser during your orientation to ask all those questions, along with course selections.   But you could keep my comment and look back into it after the orientation.   Here are my responses.  1. Have you transferred Econ 101&102? If not, go for that first since they‚Äôre introductory economics. I‚Äôd not recommend take economic electives(300 level) in first year. Get done with your general distribution if you‚Äôve not (Though I did not do any GE at Michigan since they are satisfied by IB test credits).  2. Do you have a solid foundation of Calculus? That said, do you have AP or Ib credits? If yes, I‚Äôd highly recommend take CALC 3, 215.   To summarize, if you‚Äôre hard working and ambitious guy, your first semester plan could be  Fall 21 semester : A CALC class (MATH 115,116,215) + ECON 101,102 + one GE   Then in the winter semester, you could dive into Intermediate seq (401,402).   3. I really have no suggestion for LSA kids to compete for finance jobs in freshmen. It is nearly impossible from my experience. It‚Äôs better to have good grades, connect with peers, enjoy campus activities, take enough classes rather than apply numerous internships.   4. For business electives, I doubt if you can get into them when you‚Äôre freshmen. You could try to participate in some business clubs, though.   [You could keep this for future use] When you‚Äôre sophomore or junior, Here is a list of finance classess which non-ross students can take, (Fin 302, 317, 342, 408-409, 415, 412-414, 428, 475). That said, after Fin 302 (making financial decisions), the core finance class in Ross, you can gain access to a bunch of advanced finance classes. Some requires override permissions but you'll get them if you do well in Fin 302.  Some other classes such as Acctg 471 should also be open to Non-Ross kids and I've taken most of them in my early college when I was still looking for jobs. (I‚Äôm in LSA); Feel free to PM me if you want to know more information in the future.
comment,Degree,positive,hey i studied econ freshmen year, feel free to message me for any questions !
post,Parking,positive,Hello,  Next year I will be commuting to Ann Arbor. I am a senior and I am eligible for orange parking. I need a reliable parking spot that is not too far from central campus preferably. What are my best options?  &#x200B;  Thanks
comment,Parking,neutral,Buy a spot from another student whose rental house comes with a spot they don‚Äôt need. Should be able to find something within reasonable walking distance of central campus.   Any orange lot would be a trek / bus ride.
comment,Parking,negative,I commuted last year (until things went remote)  and I parked in orange and took the Michigan bus. Waiting for the bus was anywhere between 1-15 minutes and the bus ride itself was 15-20 minutes depending on which orange lot I parked in. So if I wanted to make sure I was on time I would have be at the bus stop at least 40 minutes before class. It got really annoying and I started to look for parking on central campus and then covid hit
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Is there anywhere right now to do work/class outside with outlets for charging my laptop?!!!!?? this would be so ideal
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I‚Äôm not sure about outlets but all the outdoor study tents that were up in the fall should be up and running within the next few days. I would run by one and see if they have outlets
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,North campus near the BBB has tables with outlets. Not sure if they‚Äôre turned on right now, though
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Need to take a headshot soon-anyone know a good photographer?   I‚Äôve seen a lot of students take their headshots in the Ross building and I want something similar.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I would say post on one of the Umich facebook pages - there are a ton of talented student photographers
post,Class,neutral,Just wanted to double check things before I schedule tomorrow morning :/
comment,Class,positive,Yeah it's down :/ real convenient with an 8:30 registration time

comment,Media,positive,Today was magical, in the sense that campus felt more alive than it has in a long time. I‚Äôm sure it will feel ten-fold like this for people come next fall, but today brought a charge of hope and happiness, at least for me :)
comment,Media,neutral,I don‚Äôt see any masks üò∑
post,COVID-19,positive,question in the title, i‚Äôm already vaccinated and don‚Äôt feel like getting tested this week. would my access to buildings be revoked
comment,COVID-19,negative,You don‚Äôt want to risk that. There are people at many building entrances looking for your green check for ResponsiBLUE
comment,COVID-19,positive,Yes, they will be revoked by the MCard office. Just get tested, it‚Äôs not that hard.
comment,COVID-19,positive,The university probably has no way of knowing whether or not you're vaccinated in the first place, unless you get it done through the U, and as far as I'm aware there isn't even really a formal framework for informing the U you're vaxed  so yeah you're gonna be locked out  go spit in a tube, my dude
comment,COVID-19,positive,You still have to get tested every week even if you are fully vaccinated and reached full immunity. The simplest reason (that doesn‚Äôt delve into the subject of whether you can spread the disease if you are vaccinated) is that the university doesn‚Äôt have a way of knowing you are vaccinated or not and consequently it is very easy for students to get off with COVID-19 violations by claiming they are vaccinated. While it may not be convenient for some, enforcing a uniform policy (masks and testing) for all students is easier than enforcing the optimal policy (testing and masks for only unvaccinated). If you live on campus testing doesn‚Äôt take more than 10 minutes a week (I used to wait longer in dining hall lines than I do with testing rn) and if you live off campus but frequently come to campus to work or study, just get a test every 5ish days to make sure you never loose your access.
comment,COVID-19,positive,The exemption for fully vaccinated students won‚Äôt be in effect until May 4th (and the system to request it isn‚Äôt active yet).
comment,COVID-19,neutral,You should still get tested, but it takes a couple weeks of non-compliance for them to actually revoke your building access. My test has lapsed a couple times because I don't have to go in every week and it doesn't make sense to come in literally just to get a covid test (I'm also vaccinated). Just go get tested first thing once you need to be on campus again, otherwise you might get turned away by someone checking for your responsiblue
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey guys,  I got accepted to Umich and I also got around a full tuition scholarship from Oakland. I'm doing premed. Which one would you guys recommend? Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I went to Oakland for the first half of undergrad & transfered to UM Ann Arbor. Oakland is fine but unless it has changed a lot there is little campus life. You can check all your academic boxes and the instruction level is fine but there's not a lot of people doing interesting research or tons of opportunities to make connections with many other students or faculty beyond the classroom.  If you're the kind of student that's going to dig through the course catalog & challenge yourself you can get a lot more out of UM, especially at the 300 level & higher. I am glad I transferred. I think doing intro classes elsewhere worked out ok for me financially and I didn't miss the best parts of the academics are UM but I was also lucky I was accepted as a transfer and managed to land in a strong social circle right away... UM undergrads tend to form strong bonds in the first couple years so transfer students can have a harder time integrating.  And my student life really sucked before I transferred; I spent all my time commuting or working when I wasn't in class and campus was mostly dead. What will you be spending your time on if you go to Oakland outside of class?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You‚Äôve said Oakland has your tuition covered, which makes me think cost matters to you. Is that true? What‚Äôs your total cost at each school? (Sounds like you might have to pay for room and board at Oakland?)  What are you planning to major in? (Pre-med isn‚Äôt a major.)
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi guys,   I got a PhD offer from one of U-M departments (Recommendation for admission + support). I just want to know from your experience about how long does it take Rackham admission decision to come after the departmental offer?    Thank you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hi staff here. Congrats! It should be within a day or two. You may want to check in with the grad coordinator to see what the status is if you can‚Äôt figure it out in the student center. Here‚Äôs how to respond to the offer (once official from Rackham). https://rackham.umich.edu/admissions/applying/respond-to-the-offer/
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Be sure they've sent that recommendation along to Rackham - if they have, it should be pretty quick, but if they haven't Rackham obviously won't respond.
post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,So the union closes at 9 because of COVID.  I have a lot of work I need to do the next few nights and don‚Äôt want to do it at my house.  Are there any building/cafes/etc. that are open to use after 9?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I just heard that from Monday the union hours are extended until midnight now (heard from someone who works at the info desk there)
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,If you can get into the mason hall/angell hall complex before 5pm, you can stay in there all night. Even if you don't want to stay all night, its nice if you can get a classroom all to yourself since its quiet.
post,COVID-19,neutral,Hey y'all  Anybody planning to go to Ford Field for the Vaccine this Friday or Saturday? Anybody know good options to get to Detroit? Greyhound isn't scheduling same-day roundtrips and an Uber is gonna hurt my pockets...
comment,COVID-19,positive,Greyhound and carpooling sounds counter-intuitive (unless you‚Äôre all from the same household per car). Sounds like you could get covid on the way there.  Unfortunately safest way is to wait until Michigan Stadium opens up to all students. If you‚Äôre looking for it ASAP, rent a car via zip car, rental agency, or Turo app.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,rent a maven car? may be cheaper if you get a first sign up deal?
post,Class,positive,I've found this course called EECS 480 ([https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/EECS%20480/](https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/EECS%20480/)) that I'd be really interested in taking for my capstone/MDE for Computer Science, but it looks like it isn't being offered next semester. It appears to have been last offered in Winter 2020. Does anyone one know why this class hasn't been offered as of late? Has it been cancelled permanently? Was it just temporarily halted due to COVID? Does anyone think it'll come back for Winter 2022 semester?  Thank you in advance
comment,Class,positive,Atlas goes back 5 years, so it looks like it's only been offered once in the last 5 years which isn't a good sign. Also that one time it was taught by Walter Lasecki... so they'll probably need a new professor to take the class up if they decide to bring it back. I mean you can try contacting the department and showing your interest, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
post,Prospective Student,negative,Anyone hear back from admissions at Penny Stamps school of art and design? I haven't heard anything and I'm worried...
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Emailed admissions and ask for timeline on hearing back it‚Äôs not gonna hurt your decision
post,COVID-19,positive,I have a Florida ID and a Michigan insurance plan, should I bring mail?  &#x200B;  Thank you.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I don't think they actually checked my ID, but a Florida ID will be sufficient. AFAIK vaccine appointments in Michigan aren't restricted to Michigan residents.
comment,COVID-19,positive,They only checked my id so they get my name right when they write it onto the vax card. Your FL Id should be just fine.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,They checked literally nothing for me. I could have walked in from the street with no appointment, no ID, no insurance information, nothing...  That being said I‚Äôd still bring stuff just in case, and what you‚Äôve got should be plenty
post,Employment,positive,Hello! I am a grad student in the SSW.   I was offered a position as a COVID-19 Case Investigator at UHS. The position is part time and temporary, but I‚Äôm assuming it will be at least three-six months. I still work my case manager position (about 20 hrs a week) and I am attending SSW classes part time. I have a great deal of social work experience as I‚Äôve been in the field for almost 10 years.   I would love to eventually work at Umich more permanently since the benefits are good and the pay is pretty good as well, my hope is to eventually replace my full time job with a position at U of M once my investigator position ends. I‚Äôm super interested in the TRAILS program or something similar. I have applied for a dozen jobs at U of M and this is the first offer I‚Äôve gotten.  This seems too good to be true. Am I reading too much into this? Is this a good way to get my foot in the door at U of M? Has anyone had any experience starting in a temporary position and then moving to something full time? If so, what was the process like?
comment,Employment,positive,I don't have much I could offer for insight on the COVID position (it all seems pretty straightforward from what you've described). However in my experience applying for jobs and being involved in hiring processes it is MUCH easier to get consideration when you already work at UM, even if in a temp position.
comment,Employment,positive,Is there any better job for a SSW graduate?
post,Research,positive,Hey guys. I‚Äôm sorry if this question has been asked before, but I was wondering how easy it is for first year engineering students to get research opportunities by cold emailing. I know UROP is an option but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs really hit or miss. If anyone has any experience in nanotechnology, that‚Äôs primarily what I‚Äôm interested in but I‚Äôm just curious in general
comment,Research,positive,Are you interested in paid research opportunities or are you able to consider working on a volunteer basis?  If you need to be paid and are eligible for work study, UROP is a good option. (If you find a research job on your own, the lab can also use work study funding to help pay you, but it doesn‚Äôt fund 100% of your wage. I think my research advisor said he would have had to kick in something like 40%, so I did research for academic credit instead.)  If you‚Äôre able to work for free, you‚Äôll have more opportunities to choose from - especially as a new student without much experience or coursework under your belt.
comment,Research,positive,If you are in engineering, also check out the Multidisciplinary Design Program. They have faculty-sponsered project teams that basically does academic research, as well as industry-sponsered position more akin to coops and internships.
post,Class,negative,I actually just left a class because of how disrespectful and unprofessional my professor was being. He spent solidly the first 20 minutes of class talking about how top performers in the class getting low grades on an assessment were "slacking off" and suggested we had perhaps answered questions randomly. Maybe I'm overreacting and we're all just stressed because of the end of this semester, but that seems incredibly disrespectful to your students. Sure, you're in charge, but stop berating us like children for your shortcomings and for not "trying harder."
comment,Class,neutral,I peaced out of a class when a professor spent the first 20 minutes dissecting an interesting case study about Kendrick Lamar stealing someone elses intellectual property, only for this professor to use this lesson as an introduction to her actual purpose of telling us students that we need to stop screenshotting the lecture and using them in notes because it's her intellectual property and we're stealing from her.
comment,Class,neutral,What class and professor?
comment,Class,negative,I remember in high school walking out of a class because the teacher was joking about one of my classmate‚Äôs national background, plus earlier he had spent a whole period talking about how hot he found a price is right showgirl. Guess shitty educators exist everywhere, huh? Sad to see your prof be so disrespectful.
comment,Class,negative,Drop a name, or at least a class number

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello! I was recently admitted to UMich, and saw my financial aid decision which makes it pretty difficult for me to go. I saw that you can appeal the financial aid decision, but wanted to ask if I should only do it through the fin aid portal, or if I should also send an email to the fin aid office explaining my situation. Thank you!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Talk to a financial aid advisor.  Call or set up an in person appointment to appeal the decision.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I would check the scholarships too. I got $1k from Michigan Competitive Scholarship and $1k from my department on top of extra outside stuff. I believe it‚Äôs too late for both of those, but look up local scholarships too, I know a lot of places are giving away $500+.
post,Housing,positive,Hi everyone! I just accepted the offer to come to UMich for my Ph.D. and I am super excited! I just applied for housing in Northwood (just because at the moment it is the easiest thing for me with the pandemic and not being able to visit the area). When will I find out whether I have housing in Northwood? I just don't want to get screwed over and not have housing last minute. Thank you!
comment,Housing,negative,I applied the year I started and didn't hear anything back until summertime (I called them and asked, that was the only reason they replied). They didn't have anything available, which was lame, but at that point I had already found another place.
comment,Housing,positive,i recommend having escher coop as a good north campus back up to have your own room and food in the same area!
comment,Housing,positive,I would simultaneously start looking  The year I was accepted my grad offer in February and applied to northwood then too And was basically told at the preview weekend in April if you haven‚Äôt applied yet assume you‚Äôre on the waitlist  Grad housing is really popular in general particularly for international student and even more so this year with covid (since the university let people back out of their contracts until the last minute)
post,Food / Culture,positive,I have heard from friends, acquaintances, and the Internet that Quickly replaced an old boba shop that used to be a go to shop named Bubble Island. I would like to hear your experiences about Bubble Island since I was not a student at the time when it was running for business. I heard it held sentimental value for some A2 residents.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,The reason Bubble Island had sentimental value is largely derived from the aspect of it being effectively the only boba shop in walkable distance of campus   (yeah yeah Sweeting was also a thing, but it seemed like most people in my circles never went)  Then we started getting a bunch of new ones like the past 2-3 years. Bubble Island was alright, didn't really seem like anything special, just something that was the known option for boba for my first few years here before the new places rolled up.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Bubble Island was cool because it was open so late, but the tea itself was just okay (and the selection sucked!). I‚Äôm enjoying Quickly quite a bit more lol
comment,Food / Culture,positive,All I remember is one of the workers sneezed in my drink one time and gave it to me free instead of making me a new one lmao
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Bubble Island was the place were I discovered boba, so for that reason it will always mean a lot to me. The move was always bubble island then pinball petes.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Late night Oreo bubble tea and mozzarella sticks with friends after rock climbing. Really nice students worked there too, even when lines were long...i miss that placeü•≤
comment,Food / Culture,positive,quickly is significantly better, bubble island was only good because it was dirt cheap
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,OÃ•Õ¶oÃ•Õ¶oÃ•Õ¶oÃ•Õ¶oÃ•Õ¶ BÃ•Õ¶uÃ•Õ¶bÃ•Õ¶bÃ•Õ¶lÃ•Õ¶eÃ•Õ¶ IÃ•Õ¶sÃ•Õ¶lÃ•Õ¶aÃ•Õ¶nÃ•Õ¶dÃ•Õ¶
comment,Food / Culture,positive,My friends and I used to buy boba and play board/card games there, bc they had a sorry board and a deck of cards. I miss it a lot :(
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Bubble Island was super nostalgic because it was the only boba place around (other than Sweeting, which like another commenter said, no one really went to lol), and it had two couches with a little coffee table + games that you could sit and hang around. The drinks themselves weren't that good (although their curly fries were great!), but yeah it's mostly the sentimental value from being an iconic & dependable hanging spot that worked at any time of day, any time of year, any occasion :') I'm definitely enjoying the tea from the newer places better, but will miss the memories from Bubble Island
post,Housing,positive,How many people tend to stay in the dorms during the spring/summer semesters? The dates for this year happen to be quite convenient for me, so I was wondering what the advantages were for staying in the dorms vs in an apartment for the summer.
comment,Housing,negative,Subletting an apartment or house is much cheaper than staying in the dorms, so it‚Äôs more common. Also, subletting accommodates students who are working in Ann Arbor or doing research or something - not just those enrolled in UM classes. The only real disadvantage is needing to cook for yourself and needing to negotiate rent (and maybe negotiate furniture being left for your use, or moving your own stuff in).   An in between option (cheaper than the dorms, but lower effort than subletting) would be a summer contract in a co-op house.
comment,Housing,positive,Very, very, very few people dorm in the summer because it's so financially irresponsible unless you're getting free dorms outta some special situation. You generally have to be enrolled in courses and, generally, there's not a lot of options. Stockwell is sorta the main one I think for non-special-program summer dorming.  When I summer RA'd, we were at about 1/5th operating capacity, my floor had 0 residents, and the hall I was assigned to watch over had legitimately two people in it for most of the time. Spring term has a bit more population than summer term.  Apartment Advantages: extremely cheap compared to dorming (you can nab a fancy-ass high-rise for $500/month, which I did a few times), more space for less money, having a kitchen, etc.  Dining Hall Side-Note :: If you're not ready to learn how to cook, nothing is stopping you from getting an overpriced, mediocre meal plan, just keep in mind that summer hours are really restricted and most dining halls are shut. I think MoJo may have been the only one open when I was working summers, with South Quad open but for special summercamp programs and not general student population, maybe also Bursley, but can't remember, wasn't on north much. As someone who was relying on it since it was part of my compensation, honestly, it sucked.  Dorm Advantages: ... eh, not really anything. There isn't *really* a social vibe in the summer like there is in a normal school year. You can *try*, just there's not much added opportunity there.
comment,Housing,positive,if you want your own room and some community over the summer you should check out the coops! food is still included too so you won‚Äôt have to worry about grocery shopping, and it‚Äôs alright if you aren‚Äôt taking classes . the contract dates for the icc are like the university and offers flexibility (you could stay for june only, etc!) they‚Äôre all around campus and super close too  the website is www.icc.coop and there‚Äôs videos on them https://youtube.com/channel/UCDgQCg-qPEBQLJWH9NzCg3Q on the youtube!
comment,Housing,neutral,The dorms are closed during the spring summer semesters.
comment,Housing,positive,I'd recommend an apartment, but be wary of the lease dates because many apartments around campus (especially the high-rise ones) have everyone leave during the first week of August. I subletted in Landmark for $400/month in 2019, and I was happy until I learned that I needed to cut my summer research short because I couldn't stay in my apartment past August 5th. I also signed a lease for next school year at Foundry, and they do the same thing (there are 3 weeks in August that my lease doesn't cover).
post,Prospective Student,positive,I've been seeing quite a few posts over the last few days asking people to compare program X at Michigan with the corresponding program at another school. Please please please recognize that this is a sub comprised mostly of students and alums, all of whom are slightly biased towards (or against) this University. We can offer perspective on Michigan, or maybe our thought process (if we had the same/a similar choice to yours) but outside of that, **it's hard to compare a program at one's school to one you've never experienced.**  &#x200B;  At the end of the day, the college decision is yours and yours alone. While there may be limiting factors involved (i.e. money, distance from home, etc.), the best college choice for you will be the college that **YOU** feel the happiest at, the college that **YOU** think sets you up the best for a successful career. We can offer our experiences, but ultimately it is **YOUR** opinion that should matter most.  Sit down and think about these things, trust your gut. Definitely make an **informed** decision though! When I was applying to school, members of this sub were always willing to sit down with me and answer any questions I had about the school (now, as a student, I definitely am still open to this, and I imagine I am not alone in that mindset!), but it truly came down to how I felt when I visited, and realized that Michigan was the best place for **ME** to go to be socially and academically in a fantastic environment. That may not necessarily be Michigan for you, but hopefully you can keep some of these things in mind and best of luck choosing a school! As I said, my messages are always open if you have any questions!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,> At the end of the day, the college decision is yours and yours alone.

We can offer our experiences, but ultimately it is YOUR opinion that should matter most.  This is what I have been wanting to post on all of those threads but you have said it much better than I could have. It seems like a crazy number of posts but I keep trying to have the perspective of, 'Yeah well somebody just making the decision on their own or with their family isn't going to make a thread about it', so not exactly a fair representation of how people are behaving.   It never would have occurred to me to ask internet strangers for their opinion when I was deciding. It wasn't insanely long ago but still a different time maybe. Also I only got in to two schools and had no interest in attending one...so really wasn't much of a decision to be made. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Yes! This school is great for everyone and terrible for some. It all depends on the person and each person experiences it differently.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It's a bit like car shopping. Some people still buy objectively terrible cars and love them, others buy highly recommended cars and don't like them at all, or 'get a lemon' and don't have the user experience they were lead to believe they would have.   Some of that can come down to pure dumb luck (or bad expectations).  Personally, I had the absolute time of my life at Michigan and received a phenomenal education that I might not have received anywhere else, and made great friends who I still vacation with decades later. However, to anyone looking at schools, I would highly recommend spending at least a weekend on the campus touring it and getting a feel for the vibe of the place.   Much like with car shopping, the internet can only be so useful, and it is never a proxy for real experience you will have in person. Even then, your test drive might feel great, and you could still end up with a 'lemon' experience, which then boils down to how you handle \*that\* situation when you wind up in it. To continue the 'car' analogy, I've had two supposedly 'good' cars bought back under the lemon law, and owned four Saabs (among 25 other cars now) that were all fantastic.   Life is what you make of it, and college is part of that, so to a large degree it is still up to you to create the experience you want, regardless of what's thrown at you along the way.  If you're looking at graduate level programs, you're in a better position to judge as well as handle the resulting decision, but if you're a high school student, college is a bit like buying your first car; You have no meaningful experience from which to judge this big decision, so that's where you really need to spend time visiting/touring (meaning attending the school-given tours as well as your own exploration) of different campuses and comparing how the places feel to you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,To future freshman: Also, recognize that even though deciding the college you go to is an important part of your life.. ultimately your success is on you. Tbh I don't think the school you go to has much influence on your long term career.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Yeah but you should still come here it‚Äôs better
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,That's the thing . . .they are trying to form an opinion but don't have enough know abouts to make a decision, so if they ask this question in both subreddits and get a  feel for the answers, they have an idea now what to choose.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello guys,  Which undergraduate program should I choose if I want to get a job in investment banking after graduating?   * I have the chance to transfer to Ross, because I didn‚Äôt apply preferred admission.  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ml9223)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I chose Michigan over UNC (although for different programs). I felt like Michigan was a step up  academically and pretty similar culture-wise.
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Title basically says it all, the only thrift store I know in the area is Salvation Army and I wanted to expand my range! I don't have a car, so I would prefer for it to be walkable or bus-accessible. Thanks!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Value World is much better than the salvation army in Ann Arbor. However, it is in Ypsi. Thrift stores in Ann Arbor are pretty picked over. If you have a car or a day to invest I would recommend checking out ValueWorld. Most rewarding are the *outlet* thrift stores (goodwill or salvation army *outlets)* if you have a car and time. They are dollars per POUND of clothing and so rewarding for the time and effort you put in to go there. However, they are quite far from ann arbor. I would recommend getting some friends together and making a day of it. Totally worth it and hardly anyone knows about them/will put in the time to go there.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Check out Ann Arbor Thrift Shop and the PTO shop. Both on bus routes
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,The coolest one I‚Äôve ever been to is sharehouse, but it's far. But something to keep in mind if you ever get the chance!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,PTO is great, they run really steep sales weekly, I got two pairs of like-new work pants there for 50¬¢ each! Salvation Army is close to there and has a much wider selection (especially for men‚Äôs clothes), but not the same kind of sales. Both are worth checking out though.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Plato‚Äôs Closet in Ann Arbor is awesome! I used to work there, the staff is super nice and they always have the cutest stuff for pretty good prices. It‚Äôs not too far from the Salvation Army.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,How has nobody mentioned Ragstock yet? Their stuff is all over the place but you can find some amazing shit there.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I always found St. Vincent DePaul to have a better seletion. I bought a tuxedo there!  By better, I mean, because their store is smaller, they keep only the very best stuff and recycle the rest.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,If you can get a friend with a car to get up early and go with you, check out Kiwanis. They're only open for like three or four hours on Fridays and Saturdays (think farmer's market hours??), it's a massive place, and it's just an awesome experience.
post,COVID-19,negative,Has anyone been to the EMU center to get vaccinated?   I used the wrong link(above 50-year-old) from Washtenaw Health Department and appointed a vaccine, but I'm above 18+ and eligible for vaccination.  Shall I cancel it and leave it to others cuz it's applied thru the wrong way or shall I just go EMU nonetheless.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,You should get a vaccine. Also, there are plenty of appointments at Ford Field available if you are willing to drive
post,Prospective Student,positive,I know I am going to get biased opinions but I might as well ask anyway. I currently want to explore investment banking in NYC but I‚Äôm definitely not dead set on it. From a social aspect, umich wins by a mile but everyone is telling me nyu is better for recruiting since it‚Äôs in the heart of all the action. Did any of y‚Äôall have to make a similar decision and why did you end up choosing umich?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You'll get better professional opportunities at NYU with it being literally in NYC, you'll get a better college experience at UMich  I've heard some bad stories about how overly competitive people got at NYU's recruiting season, where people are generally friendly with each other here in Stephen M Ross's ego boosting university program
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I Turned down stern for Ross. At my school 18 people was accepted to stern, I was the only Ross admit. Best decision I have ever made.

comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm a tutor for student athletes. The majority of them are hardworking individuals, especially when it comes to academics.  Then there are others who just want to pass. For some student athletes, they‚Äôre only at Michigan for the athletics. Sometimes school may come second to them (even tho I and the tutoring staff  encourage academics to come first).  You probably just ran into a lesser motivated student athlete. They‚Äôre not all like that!
comment,Class,positive,I had an introductory Spanish class with someone on the football team, and he ended up being my partner for the oral exam at the end of the semester. I thought he did a great job -- he worked hard at the class, and made time to prep for the exam.

post,COVID-19,positive,I'm currently a freshman at another 4-year university and was recently admitted to U of M last month as a transfer student for Summer 2021. I know that they limited housing this semester, but are there a lot of people still on campus?. If someone could give me a number or percentage of people that are on campus right now versus staying at home that would be great!
comment,COVID-19,positive,Nobody really has an exact number for you, I think  But personally like 90% of people I know who are still attending (juniors, seniors, masters-level) are off-campus but living in Ann Arbor. And it anecdotally seems like the dorms are deadish, but like most people just moved from dorms to off-campus apartments winter semester
comment,COVID-19,positive,The dorms are at about 20% capacity. People who aren‚Äôt living in the dorms are pretty much all here though because we‚Äôre stuck paying rent.
comment,COVID-19,negative,Hhmmm, I feel like freshmen are probably 60% likely to be on campus, sophomores 70%, juniors 80%, and seniors 90%. Possibly even lower - it‚Äôs difficult to judge when everyone is social distancing on and off campus
comment,COVID-19,positive,Personally i live in the icc coops (the inter-cooperative council) and about 75% full right now for winter! if you want a small community to be supported by and have for transferring in i highly recommend checking them out. a lot of my housemates are transfer students and they said it made transitioning 100% better !!
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey guys!   So I got accepted into both Ann Arbor and Wayne State, both with full rides. For Ann Arbor, I have to do a Summer program to join in the fall.  Now you might say go for Ann Arbor, but from reading around it seems the courses are really extensive and difficult. Plus research Opportunities are said to be very competitive, unlike Wayne.  (My major is Biology btw.)  So idk rn, I have a friend who is most likely going to Wayne and I want to go with him, but Ann Arbor is apparently vastly better than Wayne.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,imo if money isn‚Äôt an issue (since you have full rides both places), the quality of education here is better than what you‚Äôd get at Wayne (at least in my experience taking a few transfer credits there)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As someone that transferred from a similar caliber school (think GVSU, Oakland, EMU, etc) as a Pre-Med as well - UMich is WAY better. Sure you will have to work harder, but its worth it imo. The opportunities to do research and volunteer at a world renown hospital system is unparalleled. Getting a research position was not that competitive to me at least. There are quite literally thousands of labs to join. It's just a matter of sitting down and grinding through cold emailing professors and faculty with genuine interest. Additionally UMich has a much higher average number of students getting into medical school compared to other schools: https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/um-graduates‚Äô-medical-school-application. Picking UMich is a no brainer to me.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Decision is up to you, but my personal preference in such a scenario would be umich. If you are worried about course difficulty, do your research ahead on which classes are tough and which are not, and arrange your schedule accordingly. Although I haven't been to or taken classes at Wayne state, just from the numbers and rankings it seems like Wayne state is incomparable to umich. For the research opportunities, I don't think it is impossible to get if you are very deliberate about pursuing such opportunities from the start (I'll let other fellow redditors chime in on this one cause I really haven't given this much thought myself as a CS major). I think the community and reach of the University of Michigan itself is a selling point - I've met people and been taught by professors who are leaders in their field. Although I'm in computer science, I've heard very similar about other programs. Moreover, although Wayne State is pretty good for medicine (from what I've anecdotally heard) , if at some point you decide its not for you, Michigan is a top school for almost any other field you can think of. However, keep in mind the conditions of your scholarship and whether changing majors affects it.  In general, Ann Arbor is a nice city, the programs are great, there's flexibility at umich, and there's an amazing and thriving student life (in a non-covid year). Although some classes are hard, my experience is that if you plan out classes strategically, and are aware of the support resources available to you, you can do well.  At the end of the day, its your decision, and you know your situation best. Advice I, or anyone, gives you on this forum may or may not be applicable to you because its usually from our own experiences which may be wildly different from anyone else's.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You will be successful at Michigan, your Wayne State friend will come up weekends to see you and vice versa, you will have great research opportunities, and you will have support in your classes. You have a huge opportunity here‚Äî a UofM degree opens so many doors to bigger and better things. That‚Äôs how it was for me and my friend who went to Wayne.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Easily choice of Ann Arbor, no way in hell you have a better college experience at Wayne. Its basically a 99 percent commuter school with half of the graduates being ttansfers
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Go to Michigan! You also never know where you‚Äôll end up in four years‚Äîcontinuing down a Pre-Med path or finding a new interest and changing majors. Overall, UMICH is your best bet for any route you take.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I did the summer program for Ann Arbor! I also got a full ride when I came and I‚Äôm a premed student! Definitely come to umich, you won‚Äôt regret it. I messaged you in case you have any questions or wanna chat more!
comment,Prospective Student,negative,There's a lot to be said for fit and subjectivity in choosing a college, and in most cases individual circumstances should sway a decision. I think this is not one of those times. By every metric, Michigan beats the absolute piss out of Wayne. They aren't even in the same country, much less the same ballpark. Your concerns about difficulty are certainly valid - many courses, especially pre-med ones, seem intentionally designed to beat the shit out of you. I'd argue that, if you're the kind of person who can get into michigan, you'd be much more satisfied being challenged at michigan than bored at wayne.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,i was in the exact same scenario with wayne umich no money involved. it came down to me wanting to have a real college experience that you simply cannot get with wayne. GPA is definitely going to be lower but as much as people say the undergrad school doesn‚Äôt matter, it really does, but with a high gpa it won‚Äôt matter as much. it really comes down to whether or not ur ok with a lower GPA to have a real college experience
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Umich is brutally difficult for premed. That‚Äôs the rule for the premed prerequisite courses, not the exception. Seeing as how your undergrad school has little weight on med school applications, go to the school that won‚Äôt tank your GPA. Yes, it is that simple. Pick Wayne.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Wayne is a tier 3 school at best that people only go to because it is cheap.  &#x200B;  You will have a MUCH harder time getting into a top tier med school coming out of Wayne and you will also have very limited opportunities to pivot if you decide premed isn't your thing.
post,Class,positive,I am grateful that the SI 110 staff decided to cancel the last quiz of the semester and give everyone the full points. This is great considering the fact that they allowed the class to have a clearer focus on completing their other academic endeavors from SI 110 and other classes. I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
comment,Class,neutral,Where are you seeing this?!!!!!! This is unreal
comment,Class,positive,Awesome!
comment,Class,positive,Pretty sure they did this with one of the quizzes last semester too. Mad chill.
post,COVID-19,positive,Hello, I was wondering if any student or anyone with any knowledge could tell me when the university is planning on allowing students to get vaccinated through the university. I see that Oakland University is allowing for this time of program beginning on the 7th. I have filled out the blue queue survey and I really haven‚Äôt heard anything for months. With the state of Michigan allowing anyone over the age of 16 permitted to get the vaccine, is the university planning on doing the same? Thanks!
comment,COVID-19,positive,I would recommend not waiting for the school to be able to offer you a dose. If you can find one at a pharmacy or grocery store, take that. (I‚Äôm not saying the school won‚Äôt ever vaccinate students, but you can help minimize how much they need to do if you take a shot when you‚Äôre offered one elsewhere.)
comment,COVID-19,negative,To be cynical-but-probably-not-inaccurate: the second week of May, once students have evacuated Ann Arbor for the season
comment,COVID-19,positive,MM is getting their doses from the state‚Äôs contracts with manufacturers (primarily Pfizer), so their supply hasn‚Äôt really ramped up all that fast. Moreover, they are focusing on their patient population, so they are still prioritizing those who are older and have comorbidities. They are posting weekly updates on their progress here: https://www.uofmhealth.org/coronavirus/vaccine-info-update and on pages linked from here.  Various retail pharmacies are getting their supply from the federal sources, which have ramped up significantly, so I think for the foreseeable future that‚Äôs going to be a more likely source of appointments for younger, healthier folks.   I don‚Äôt know if UofM is in a position to procure a dedicated shipment of doses for a vaccination drive for students right now. Oakland and Wayne State are located in counties which have higher infection rates than Washtenaw, and so vaccinating their students (many more of whom are local commuters compared to UofM) goes hand in hand with the overall priority for more vulnerable populations. Besides, unless we can get J&J vaccine (which had a manufacturing snafu recently), UofM can‚Äôt start a vaccination drive now and have time for the second round of shots before the end of classes.  I sincerely hope that by the time Fall semester approaches, there‚Äôll be plenty of doses obtainable, and UofM is able to arrange a vaccination drive for students who didn‚Äôt get a chance to get vaccines over the summer, especially international ones coming from places where vaccination is going slower than in the US. But that‚Äôs speculation on my part.  Edited to add: well, would you look at that! It begins! https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/mm24v4/upcoming_vaccination_options_for_students/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
comment,COVID-19,positive,I would suggest using these two resources to find available vaccine doses nearby:  [COVID Vaccine Spotter](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/MI/?fbclid=IwAR1dJcKnvzC7zpk0yA7V13SkNsv3Hlx5EXX4nImzoxS_AxQt1i0MGTuHcVA&radius=100&zip=48105&vaccine_type=pfizer)  [Washtenaw Health Department](https://www.washtenaw.org/3269/COVID-19-Vaccination)  I have heard there's going to be a slowdown in vaccine distribution by Michigan Medicine due to some state regulations, so your best bet for now is to look for external sources

post,New Student,neutral,Hello,  I'm admitted to the ece grad program at U of M (Ann arbor).  I am wondering when I can sign up for health insurance I don't see any information anywhere to sign up for health insurance plans for fall 2021.  Could someone let me know how / when I do this?
comment,New Student,neutral,Are you a PhD student? Then insurance is usually part of your funding package.   If you are buying your own policy from the university, you need to actually enroll at the university to become eligible. It seems they haven‚Äôt published rates for Fall enrollment yet, but they usually don‚Äôt change much within the calendar year, so you can more or less expect the current rates.

post,Student Organization,positive,Hi ! I'm an incoming freshman at the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor . I plan on majoring in CS at LSA. I recently got into WISE-RP. It would be great if y'all could give me more information about the program.. like the classes required, internships, research opportunities etc?  Thanks !
comment,Student Organization,positive,hey there! i'm sorry this isn't super helpful, but i just got into WISE RP too- excited to see you this fall! :)
post,Prospective Student,positive,I plan on majoring in math (applied or pure, I have only taken up through Calc III and don't feel like I've had enough exposure to decide yet) but I'm not sure how to chose between UMich, NYU, and JHU. At UMich, I would be doing a math/violin performance double degree. At NYU and JHU, just music minors. I am wondering:  Can anyone attest to the intensity of the double degree program? I am wondering if it will be too much for me.  The math program: overlap between pure/applied, class variety, research accessibility for undergrads, and student/professor interaction (are most of the classes taught by professors or grad students? Since UMich is such a big school, is it hard to develop one-on-one relationships with the profs, etc)  Any info would be helpful and if you have input on my choice of colleges or want to vouch for UMich please do!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hey! Also LSA/SMTD dual degree here, but not a math major. Math and Violin Performance at UofM are both top tier here and pretty intense, but I would say it‚Äôs definitely doable and you‚Äôll meet other dual degree majors while at the music school. You‚Äôre going to have to learn how to balance both and it‚Äôs going to be hard, but it‚Äôs not too much. If it becomes too much, you can always switch to major in just one and minor in the other. I can‚Äôt attest to the math department in terms of research or anything tho so I can‚Äôt answer your second question
comment,Prospective Student,positive,math major here but not in SMTD (although take some classes in it, music minor), our math bachelors does not have an applied form, though we have a few "submajors," which are: pure, honors (also pure, just more classes), secondary teaching math, actuarial, mathematics of finance, and mathematical science (also sub-sub majors of this, intended for dual majoring with bio, chem, physics, CS, DS, etc.).  As for the difference, they have different "core classes." Essentially, if you want to go into math that isn't actuarial or financial, you get to basically choose what you want to do beyond  these core classes. For example, the core couses of pure (mine atm) are : Linear Algebra, Diff Eq, Analysis, Modern Algebra. From there, you have free choice (mostly). There are applied math classes and you can enroll in grad classes.  Most Math-major classes are taught by professors, I believe the Honors sequence is taught by post-docs.  Not sure about research yet.  Lastly, a lot of math courses are "IBL," or "Inquiry Based Learning." The class works on problems in groups of 3-5 and the professor floats around for more personal time. If you are a math student, it seems to be kinda universally enjoyed. I've been able to talk to my prof and form a stronger relationship than I think I would have been able to in traditional lecture.  Sorry for the cluster of a reply lmao, but happy to answer any more questions I can!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Also a math major, though not in SMTD. The math program is huge and (importantly!!) very flexible. I know a good number of double majors (I am one), but I can‚Äôt necessarily speak to a double degree. There‚Äôs a huge variety of courses you can take. Past the intro calc sequence, it‚Äôs pretty much entirely faculty and grad students, and most are under like 25-30 people. Profs are very accessible via office hours and it‚Äôs not hard to build relationships with faculty. There are multiple research opportunities, some that are integrated into credit work, plus UM has its own REU that takes UM students over the summer. It‚Äôs also just a really nice community, particularly during non-pandemic times. There are pretty much always (and I mean always) math majors chilling in East hall, and often not because we‚Äôre so swamped with work that we can‚Äôt leave, but rather because it‚Äôs also just a social space. Math is of course still a pretty intense time, pretty much regardless of which major you do, but it‚Äôs definitely been an overall good experience. The advisors are fantastic and I‚Äôve definitely come to feel like I can really call myself a mathematician ‚Äî 10/10 would recommend.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was neither a math major nor a SMTD student but that seems like a grotesque amount of work/stress. I know there are people that do dual degrees with SMTD, but I don't know how. Given that you are considering it I'm sure you have a sense of the extensive time commitment to your violin.   Small sample I know, but I knew one math major as an undergrad and they always seemed completely overrun. The few SMTD students similarly spent more time practicing than I ever did anything else. Doing both seems crazy to me.   Maybe you don't know this yet, but what is your goal long term? Career-wise does a music major or minor make that much of a difference?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,LSA/Engineering Math/CSE dual degree student here, so I can speak to doing a double degree and the math department, but not so much the music performance program.  Joint degrees are hard, but doable. You end up just having to take a lot of classes (especially with LSA distribution requirements), but other than that, it's not really different than a double major. It may take you longer than four years to graduate without spring/summer classes, but that's not inherently a bad thing.  As for the math program...  * Theoretical vs applied: There's definitely more of a slant towards theory, and even the ["applied math major"](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/mathematical-sciences.html) requires a decent amount of theory courses. But there's an excellent selection of applied courses (I've taken several), not to mention math courses in other departments which may count towards the Mathematical Sciences major. * Class variety: One of the benefits to UMich being a big school is there's a huge variety of classes. You can check out the full list of classes [here](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/undergraduate-math-courses.html) -- most of these are offered at least once a year. * Research accessibility for undergrads: I can't talk about this as much, since my research has been more towards the computer science side of things. But I have several friends who have done research as an undergrad with professors, and I know other people in this thread have talked about it. * Student/professor interaction: I've found that it's pretty easy to start to develop a one-on-one relationship with your professor. Office hours are always a great place to interact with instructors, and a lot of the upper level courses end up having somewhat small class sizes. Most classes I have taken were taught by professors.
post,Student Organization,positive,I've been admitted to the math PhD program for this fall and I'm wondering if there are pianos I can play at UM. I heard there's one at East Hall, but I'm not sure if the quality is great.  1. How good is the piano at East Hall? (I presume it's an upright.) 2. Are there pianos which non-music PhD students can practice with? How good are they? 3. Is there a piano club at UM (or just any group where people can meet and play the piano or go to piano concerts together)?  (Sidenote: I'm coming as an international student so I don't know what student clubs are like in the US.)
comment,Student Organization,positive,So:   -	i believe the piano in east quad might be a grand piano (but you‚Äôd be playing with people coming to and fro, as with most of these places on campus) -	I believe there are some in the union and the league (unsure about this one) -	up in the north campus there is the music school which can be snuck into, there are heaps of practise rooms w/ piano in there  -	there are some dorms with piano rooms but since you‚Äôre a grad student I doubt you can access them. Some dining halls also have them.  -	there is also pierpont commons and they have one (maybe two or three) grand pianos, and 2-3 upright ones. One of the upright ones is literally falling apart though. I‚Äôm not sure as to the exact numbers since they keep on moving them all over the place.   If you want a piano of good quality, unfortunately sneaking into the music school is the way to go. I‚Äôve done it a few times and it never seems to be a problem.   The public pianos don‚Äôt sound bad per se, they‚Äôre just not well maintained (some are out of tuned but not dramatically) and usually quite old. Most of them don‚Äôt have any issues like stuck keys that make them unplayable. If you‚Äôre not that serious about sound quality, they‚Äôre definitely playable.   If for some reason you need a **really** good piano, those do exist since I‚Äôve watched a friend perform on a gorgeous piano in the music school concert hall as a part of her music PhD.
comment,Student Organization,positive,I'm pretty sure the piano in East Hall is a playable, mostly in tune upright (if I remember correctly, there are sticky keys). People study there (at least before Covid), so make sure to ask if they don't mind before playing. (NotPast3 mentioned East Quad, that's a dorm where mostly undergraduates live)  I haven't heard of a piano club, but you can always make one! There are several music groups that welcome pianists. I'm not sure which ones welcome pianists, but here are the name of some groups: BlueBop Jazz Orch, Michigan Pops Orch, Campus Orch, Ontaku, Jam Club (as you can kinda guess, I am an orch dork).  The following link is a list of organizations at Michigan: [https://maizepages.umich.edu/organizations](https://maizepages.umich.edu/organizations)  Pre-Covid there were pianists that came to Hill Auditorium to perform. [https://ums.org/](https://ums.org/) now has a lot of performances online, once things start opening up, you can use the website to see who's playing and get tickets (there's a student section for most performances where you can get discounted tickets as a Umich student).  Of course, there are other performance venues in Ann Arbor such as [https://theark.org/](https://theark.org/), [https://www.blindpigmusic.com](https://www.blindpigmusic.com/) where pianists sometimes perform.
comment,Student Organization,positive,There are/were Pianos at the Union! Not sure about now with Covid but there is a grand piano in the ballroom and another regular one on the first floor
comment,Student Organization,positive,I personally like the East Hall piano a lot. It's an upright, and I don't think it's super in tune, but the keys feel good and they all work fine. You can't play it during normal business hours, but people play it all the time in the evenings and on the weekends. I use it as a way of taking a break if I'm up late doing math homework.
post,Student Organization,positive,Does anyone have any information on this? I played guitar in a jazz band in high school, but I'd really like to pick it up again next semester. How competitive is a spot? What's the time commitment like?  &#x200B;  Thanks!
comment,Student Organization,neutral,I did it my freshman year.  I wouldn't worry about getting into the band if you play guitar. As long as you can show competence, you'll likely be the sole guitar player in the band. At worst, you'll rotate with one other player.  Time commitment was 2 hours a week. The class met at 8:00PM at the SMTD building on North campus, ended at 10. Not sure if that's the same anymore. Every once in a while, the rhythm section would get together for a sectional, but it wasn't burdensome on my schedule at all.  Overall, good experience. I only left because I thought some people took it too seriously and because all the people I liked graduated.
post,Miscellaneous,neutral,anyone know how to get the Patagonia sweaters with the "M" embroidered on them? someone mentioned having to place a group order-when do those start going around?
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I also want to know about that too!!!
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi I was recently accepted into the school of nursing and I was of course thrilled! I plan on attending Umich because they‚Äôre offering me the most money as an in-state resident. However, i‚Äôm having second-doubts about my future career and I‚Äôm kind of considering going the MD route. This thought may be temporary, as my mind was first set on becoming a dermatologist or anesthesiologist...then switching to wanting to become a nurse anesthetist, but now back to square one. I admire both the nursing and doctor professions a lot, and I plan on shadowing people in both fields to actually decide (was interrupted by the pandemic unfortunately). My question is if I decided I don‚Äôt want to go the nursing route, could i switch my major/school before the start of the fall term? If not, if I transferred my sophomore year would that delay my graduation by a semester or year? Would it be smart to just continue pursuing a BSN but completing pre med reqs (I heard this may be difficult). I apologize if this is an odd question and I don‚Äôt mean to insult any profession by not figuring out what I actually intend on doing. I appreciate any answers or advice, thank you!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You could very likely switch from Nursing to LSA between freshman and sophomore year and still graduate in four years with little trouble.   I would recommend starting in Nursing because you can‚Äôt transfer back into it easily. And starting there doesn‚Äôt close the door to med school.   I would also recommend applying to live in HSSP. They do a lot of exploration of health professions, which could be really useful for you. (You don‚Äôt need to be a LSA student to join.)  https://lsa.umich.edu/hssp
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I did the opposite of you and switched from LSA premed into the School of Nursing as a sophomore transfer! It‚Äôs much harder to transfer into the school of nursing than out of it, so I definitely recommend staying in nursing for at least your first year until you are completely sure what you want to do.   I definitely also recommend talking to your advisor about this during your orientation this summer and planning which classes you want to take so that you can fulfill the nursing freshman requirements and take classes that would benefit you upon transferring to LSA as a sophomore if that‚Äôs what you decide to do! The School of Nursing student handbook (which you can find on their website under current student resources) has a section on transferring out of the school of nursing that might be helpful to read.  In my knowledge, I do not think that you can transfer before starting your freshman year, but I might be wrong! I‚Äôm not totally positive about that, I just haven‚Äôt heard anywhere that you can.   I wish you luck in figuring out what you want to do! I definitely encourage you to continue shadowing and exploring those careers (and consider lifestyle, schooling, usual day in the life) to see what fits you best! So many people change their mind during college, and taking an extra year to pursue what is best for you is not too bad in the grand scheme of things. Good luck with your decisions!
post,Prospective Student,positive,UCLA vs UMICH  Hey gang I‚Äôm hoping to study public policy at umich or public affairs at ucla. Cost isn‚Äôt a factor. I‚Äôm also pre-law most likely but i‚Äôd like to have the option to not have to go to law school if i choose  Umich pros: -public policy program seems more focused on real world solutions vs uclas program has more theory/history requirements. program has also been around longer -longterm bf going there (i know this is stupid sounding but my relationship with my family is rocky so being close to a support structure would be nice)  -ranked higher for public policy and political science   umich cons:  -not really in a city -very very cold (haven‚Äôt visited campus yet am visiting this week)   ucla pros: -big city which is important to me but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd get to really explore or if people get stuck on campus  -weather very nice -far from my family -food is very good and has lots of vegetarian options -i love california so much and have always wanted to live here  -fell in love with campus -program has a capstone study abroad/internship component -better ranked overall school (i don‚Äôt know if this matters or the difference is negligible)  -might have more opportunities bc la? not sure if this is true  ucla cons: -program is less taylored to my interests -harder to change or double major  I‚Äôm not sure what else I should consider but id say the things most important to me from college is having a good time and having the right connextions/resources/knowledge to get employed doing public service work and get into a t10 law school. let me know what you guys think or what I should consider!! If you‚Äôre in the public policy program or are prelaw or just have input pls hmu!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You‚Äôre causing a lot of wound reopening with a post title like this so soon after the Elite Eight!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,ucla/umich difference negligible. any opportunities you have via LA will likely be shared by chicago unless your interests are more tailored to LA industry. you will have a good time at either and pretty equal access to opportunities. choose which program/campus you think you'll be happier at  i'd flip a coin. if you're disappointed with the outcome, chose the other one. it does kinda sound like your leaning UCLA though.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,not gonna comment on anything else but Ann Arbor is extremely vegetarian friendly, lots of vegan/vegetarian restaurants and most restaurants have vegetarian options
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Wow what a decision to make! I would also factor in the opportunities for students who are pre-law, and what resources the schools can offer to get into law school. If you care about ranking UMich is a higher ranked law school than UCLA (#10 vs #14 on USNews). Regardless I think you'll be happy with either schools. I have obvious bias toward UMich as I am a current student. Good luck and I hope everything works out!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Both are special schools. Ann Arbor is iconic, and LA is LA. You‚Äôll have a wonderful experience wherever you choose. Good luck with your decision and remember there really is no wrong choice here.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'd go UMich, the culture here is better than UCLA, which I've heard can be bit overly academic at times from my friends there.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,This question couldn't have been at a worse time lol
comment,Prospective Student,positive,idk how competitive UCLA‚Äôs program is, but Ford only accepts about 75 students and receives upwards of 200 apps per class. if you really want to study one of these, you should go where you‚Äôre more likely to be accepted into the program
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I haven't actually researched this, but if you're looking for law school check to see which campus has a close federal court system to it.   You're going to want to intern with a judge to get into a competitive school
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Could be wrong but don't u have to apply to the public policy school at umich during ur sophomore year? If so I'd def consider that
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I had to make this decision when I was decided colleges woah. I chose UMich because I wanted to stay in the east coast closer to my parents.  This might be grass is greener, but I feel like you'd have a better college experience at UCLA where it's warm and sunny. Michigan's school semester is cold and dark.   I guess Umich's benefit is that it's a semester system rather than quarter system, and the fact that it's cold and dark might make you study harder than UCLA where you have hundreds of cool things to do in the LA sunshine
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Double major at Umich is very flexible (at here you can take a lot of fun classes for your GE like "Aliens"). If I were you, UCLA is not in my consideration.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,You can‚Äôt double major if you‚Äôre in Ford. You can pursue a minor, or double minor though.
post,Employment,positive,I don't understand how underclassmen get internships, let alone offers at top companies. My resume isn't bad by any means; I have some interesting projects and I'm an IA for a programming course. My GPA is also pretty competetive at a 3.95, and I've already taken EECS 281.   Overall, I've been pretty actively applying since October. So far, I've applied to about 150 internships, and I've received 5 interviews; all leading to rejections. Keep in mind the companies I received interviews for were tiny local companies.  Do I need to apply with actual referrals, or what? Or maybe my interviewing skills are subpar? Maybe applying on LinkedIn and Handshake isn't viable? Or maybe it's just the case that it's super rare for underclassmen to get internships, even though most of the people I know have things lined up for the summer?  This is a bit of a rant, but I want to get a good internship for next summer as a rising senior, and I feel like not doing anything this summer will hurt my chances. What are some backups I should be considering for this summer?
comment,Employment,positive,I can give you some general advice for CS internships:  1. You want to try to apply as early as possible since most companies apply on a rolling basis. You should start applying to tech companies (eg. FAANG, Unicorn) starting August/early September. For quant/hft firms you want to start applying in July/August. October may seem early but it's already pretty late for most tech companies and lots of spots are already filled by then. 2. Referrals are nice but not necessary. My advice for networking is after you first apply online (in August/September) you should try to talk with the companies you are most interested in during career fairs/company events. Most of these events will let you submit your resume, which may help fast-forward your application. 3. LinkedIn and Handshake are good ways to find job openings, but you shouldn't apply solely through LinkedIn and Handshake. In my personal experience a lot of applications through 3rd party websites (like handshake especially) are ignored. After you find a job posting, always make sure you apply through the official company website. 4. If you are just trying to get an offer, then you should apply to many places as possible. Each year you can usually find a github link with a list of internships on r/csmajors (such as this one: [https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2021-Internships](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2021-Internships)). Most of these applications just require a resume and take less than a minute to apply, so apply to as many as possible to maximize your chances. 5. If you're having trouble getting interviews then I would make sure there are no red flags on your resume. You can have some friends look at your resume (or even better reach out to alumni on LinkedIn) or schedule a career advising appointment. 6. I don't suggest writing a cover letter unless the company you are applying to is very niche/small and you have some experience specific to that niche. Most large companies won't even read your cover letter if you submit one. Sometimes you can try emailing the recruiter but ideally you want to talk to someone from the company at a career fair or event. I've personally never written a cover letter before and was able to get interviews sophomore and freshman year.
comment,Employment,positive,It's a bit late in the process but in prep for next year,  \-Have a resume that is well formatted, ideally has a personal project and other relevant internships (just code a simple mobile app front end over an API or build your own API that pulls data from a feed. Ex: I made a quick API mapping live arrival times across the NYC subway you can maybe reference [here](https://github.com/JaySeanlu/mtaNextTrain-REST-API)). If you don't get an internship this coming summer, would encourage you build stuff on your own to show off, and maybe do some LeetCode if you wanna gun for the tryhard positions. In a rat race where all CS majors have taken the same classes, internship experience and personal projects set people apart  \-Attend the career fair (hopefully in person next year), speak with recruiters about positions since they usually push candidates in front of interviewers. If you have a mobile app personal project, you can show it off in person on your phone  \-This coming summer for junior year internships, you should reach out to friends or connections you know about any internship programs they have. This is the easiest way to get an interview honestly  \-If you are really a tryhard, do what Ross students do - message alumni working at jobs you want on LinkedIn, ask for a chat, ask about projects/be personable, ask for a referral  EDIT: I honestly wouldn't spend too much time on a cover letter for a job. I doubt they get read
comment,Employment,negative,If it means anything, I'm a junior with a tech internship at a fairly well-known tech firm, and I have no idea how people do it. Last year I didn't even get a single response from anyone, and was similarly a bit scared about recruiting coming into this year.   However, I noticed companies were suddenly a million times more likely to respond or give me interviews as a junior. I wouldn't panic too much, it doesn't have the biggest bearing on next year.   &#x200B;  P.S. LinkedIn/Handshake/Indeed are all pretty much useless, companies never check them.
comment,Employment,positive,Everything is at least twice as hard right now with the lack of in-person events, but here is what I have learned from my undergrad and graduate experience:  The way many engineers think about job hunting:  * Write a resume and cover letter to emphasize your best skills and experience * Don‚Äôt bother going to career fair because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just going to tell me to apply online‚Äù * Apply to a hundred online job postings * Never hear back from most of them   The way you *should* be job hunting:  * Go to events (job fairs, tech talks, alumni events, networking events). Yes some have been cancelled but many have moved online * Have honest conversations with people you don‚Äôt know (recruiters, alumni, engineers in industry), listen and learn what skills and experience they are actually looking for and how you can contribute to their business * Leverage and mine every social connection you have (professors, family friends, classmates, your neighbor down the hall) for people they know and opportunities they‚Äôve heard of * Tailor your resume and cover letter for every application based on how you can bring value to the business rather than just emphasizing the things you feel are your best qualities  * In the long term, select opportunities based on whether they will build the experience you need for the opportunities you want
comment,Employment,positive,Did you apply for the U-M ITS internship program? It's too late now to apply but it's a really great program that mostly takes U-M students.
comment,Employment,positive,In a normal year, getting an internship as a sophomore is pretty hard. A lot of companies would rather hire juniors since it‚Äôs a better investment from their perspective. Since this isn‚Äôt a normal year, job searching in general has become much harder.   Without knowing details about your resume or where you‚Äôre applying, I could say get your resume checked by other people. 5/150 is pretty low even as a sophomore. I would schedule an advising appointment to get your resume looked at and then post it on some cs subs.  You should just keep applying and don‚Äôt limit your search. Literally just apply to any company that has an opening. If you don‚Äôt end up getting anything, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Just look into doing research and/or side projects.
comment,Employment,negative,As someone in the same boat, I just wanted to add that all the CS sophomores I know that got internships did side projects over last summer. Most of them were basically bullshit code they whipped up, and they knew it, but they included a lot of buzzwords in their git repos and stuff and apparently recruiters lapped it up.
comment,Employment,positive,For summer internships, what‚Äôs considered to be an awesome side project that stands out on the resume, especially when one doesn‚Äôt have a cs internship yet? I‚Äôm currently working on a side project but it‚Äôs simple MERN project with not a lot interesting aspects.
comment,Employment,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Employment,positive,I have some questions about writing a resume:     * should I list relevant coursework? * is it ok to put down class projects for now? I will do some of my own over the summer * should I list skills over projects or projects over skills?
comment,Employment,positive,Most people have already given great advice for getting internships, but I thought I could add a recent list I made of summer alternatives for people wanting to get experience in CS or make themselves more competitive. Hopefully it's helpful to somebody, let me know if you want more details about something.  * Build a professional portfolio website (GitHub pages, host it yourself) * Write Medium articles about programming and get paid * Create your own blog about CS (WordPress, Instagram, GitHub pages, etc.) * Freelance consulting (websites like Fiverr make this relatively easy) * Build passion projects and show off on GitHub * Contribute to the open source community (there are a lot of resources on this) * Take free online programming courses though LinkedIn Learning or Coursera * Start preparing for the next recruiting season (update resume and LinkedIn, start networking early) * Compete in Capture the Flag competitions (great if you're interested in cybersecurity) * Look into bug bounties (Hackerone is popular for this, although it might be hard to find bugs at a sophomore skill level) * Read and contribute to Stack Overflow consistently * Leetcode and Hackerrank * Get a head start on next semester‚Äôs material (not exactly experience, but can help boost GPA) * Look for a summer research position (probably too late now)  A lot of people have discussed the importance of networking but nobody has mentioned UCAN, which is the University's forum for networking with Alumni. I haven't used it a lot yet, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I also think career fairs and company events, both in person and virtual, are the best ways to get a recruiter's radar, but that's just my personal experience.
comment,Employment,positive,I'm not a CS major, but are you writing cover letters for every application you're sending? Most applications won't get read if there's no cover letter attached.   I think this year is particularly competitive for everyone given that so many internships were cancelled last summer and so there's an influx of students all fighting for the same few positions. I've also applied to way more internships this year than I have in previous years. My best advice (as a senior about to graduate) is to write a personalized cover letter for each application, and utilize Linkedin as much as you can. Look up people who are working at your dream companies and ask them for a short informational interview to ask how they got to where they are-- I have several friends who have done this and oftentimes it can lead to you gaining a mentor in the field (bonus points if they're an alum) I personally haven't done this since my field is generally less competitive than CS, but also look into the mock interview sessions, resume workshops, etc that the career center does. Also, if you haven't reached out to the people who interviewed you and asked for feedback on why you weren't chosen and what you could have done better, I would highly recommend doing that as well.   Again, I can't speak for the competition within the CS field, but keep in mind that a lot of people are struggling to land internships this year so it might not be anything you're doing wrong, just the luck of the draw in a sea of hundreds of other applicants.
comment,Employment,neutral,Most of those people either have connections at the company or tick demographic boxes the recruiter is looking for.
comment,Employment,positive,Appy locally, a lot of non-tech focused companies will be checking apps now (thats how i got a summer after soph internship)
comment,Employment,negative,Normally id peep career fair. Hell you can get an offer after freshman yr. this years a mess idk what ppl do
post,Class,positive,Does this satisfy a humanities requirement? I can't find something on the LSA course guide that has INTERHUM as a class. For more context, I'm trying to transfer "ANTH 1823: RELIGION IN EVERYDAY LIFE" from the University of Oklahoma. I'm also looking at this transfer credit tool [https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu/](https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu/)  And yes, I'm already talking to an LSA Honors advisor. But, I'm just trying to get a quicker answer b/c registration begins at OU this week.  Thanks everyone.
comment,Class,positive,Any credit with a ‚ÄúX‚Äù like that won‚Äôt satisfy a specific credit, but it will count as a general credit. I just inquired with the chem department for an organic chem credit and was told this by the LSA chem advisor.
post,COVID-19,neutral,
comment,COVID-19,negative,Holy shit, thank you.
comment,COVID-19,positive,This is REALLY helpful
post,Degree,positive,I am in a situation where I need 31 more credits after this semester to graduate. However, I am in my second year in UofM engineering right now. I want to know if I should take the 15 and 16 credits to graduate in 3 years or if I should look at possibly doing a co-op or two and graduate in 4 years. I also want to know if graduating in Winter is a good option as well. Personally, I don't really like the idea of graduating in 3 years after a year and a half of covid school but also want to not waste money taking unnecessary classes. I think a co-op semester might be the best option for me in this case where I can get some work experience and not waste money on tuition. What would you all recommend if you've been in  similar situations.
comment,Degree,positive,Graduating winter semester is not a big deal, plenty of companies hire students for that window as well.   Graduating in three years probably makes the most sense from a purely financial point of view, you‚Äôll start earning real money earlier and you‚Äôre not paying to take extra classes.  Taking three 12 credit semesters would cost more, but would free up time for clubs, extra curriculars, side projects, etc. That could be worthwhile if your resume is thin and/or you have passions to explore.   If you get an opportunity for a coop or similar that would set you up for a better job opportunity than you might otherwise be able to secure, then that‚Äôs not a bad option. Doing that could be valuable. Normal 15/16 credit semesters, plus a coop and graduating in the winter would be a reasonable plan.   Both a coop and lighter semesters to graduate in the full four years, but only paying for 3.5 would seem fine to me. You could come out of that with a pretty substantial resume that would likely help in job seeking, but who knows.   It may also be worthwhile to delay graduation if there are certain classes that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to take if you got out in 3 years, especially some upper level classes that could help you get a job in a field you might not otherwise be able to land.   If you‚Äôre just mostly worried about shorting out the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù, that‚Äôs fair. If money isn‚Äôt an issue and it makes sense for your goals, a 1 year masters through SUGS or a similar program might be worthwhile to consider as well.   In the end, it‚Äôs a personal decision, and I think the only wrong choice would be dragging it out and paying for four full years of classes without any specific reason for doing so.
comment,Degree,positive,What's your major? Did you have any other internship or work-related experience? (relevant campus jobs such as research would count ) There's plenty of people who who graduate without any internships in EECS and find a full-time job just fine. However, it'd be probably harder for somebody in a field such as Naval Arch Marine Engineering to get a full-time job without an internship.  Of course, there's the opportunity cost of staying in college when you could be employed. As good as the social aspect of Michigan is, it's not worth a a combined tuition + opportunity cost. If you're in EECS or MechE, you could even live Ann Arbor while working full-time around here. There's a thriving community of young alumni.
comment,Degree,positive,I would go for a few co-ops if you can. You'll be on pace with others in your class but with way more work experience under your belt. Finances permitting, however, you could always take an extra semester or two to make sure your GPA is on track.
comment,Degree,positive,Looking into a minor could be worthwhile too!
post,Food / Culture,positive,Hi, everyone! My name is Allison Donahue and I'm a reporter with the Michigan Advance. I am working on a story about Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expanding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for college students. If any U of M students are taking advantage of the expanded eligibility, please let me know! I'd love to talk with you today.
post,Degree,positive,Hey everyone, I recently got into the School of Information and was planning on doing the Information Analysis track. When I looked at the classes for the degree, though, it seemed like they were a lot more coding-heavy than the LSA Stats program (which I was considering if I didn‚Äôt get into the BSI). Since I don‚Äôt love coding, which program would you recommend doing, the BSI or Statistics? Thank you all for your thoughts.
comment,Degree,positive,Eh, I'd say do both (BSI+Minor), keeping in mind that the BSI IA path doesn't have a *ton* of coding. You take like one coding class per semester, really not that bad. 301/310/425 aren't programming courses, or at least they weren't when I took them, aside from touching NetworkX in like one lab session.  Programming and stats are a power-couple though, so combining the two would complement each other really well. SI won't teach you stats beyond Stats250, but it will teach you enough programming to be able to pull data from all sorts of cool places.
comment,Degree,neutral,Seconding BSI w/ applied stats. 330 can count as an applied stats course. BSI by itself has no stats courses, and will not properly prepare you for doing that type of work.
comment,Degree,negative,Do BSI and Applied Stats minor. Even a dual degree wouldn't be too bad.
post,Prospective Student,neutral,If so, how did you do it and how much did they give you? I need a few thousand more to commit and I want to be in A2 in the fall so badly :(
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I think it's worth a try. The worse they can do is say no. If your parents' income decreased in 2020, make sure you highlight that in your appeal because that's your best chance of getting more aid. Just keep in mind that the financial aid office does consider federal loans as aid, so they may or may not give you more money in grants.   Also, if you're in LSA, you can apply for LSA scholarships for future years. These are need-based so most people receive them if they have a gap in their aid package.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I tried appealing just now and they said no.  Would need to come up with 36k a year :/
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Has anyone had any luck trying to get them to match another school's offer? Will specific schools like Ross or School of information treat financial aid differently for their students than say LSA?
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey everybody I just recently got into NYU stern but previously I was set on going to Umich and was accepted into the LSA with a minor in economics. I didn‚Äôt apply to their business school called Ross which is also a top ranked undergrad business program like Stern.  Do I attend NYU and study at stern but give up college life such as football games, tail gates, school spirit, sororities and frats?  Or do I attend Umich and try to get into their business program sophomore year and be a year behind others who got in as pre admits. Also there is no certainty that I will be accepted and may just have to pay the full out of state tuition to not be in Ross.   Stuck on which school to pick. Would giving up a spot at NYU stern to gamble for a spot at Umich Ross  be my biggest regret?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,NYU is private and Michigan is public. You'll get a special type of attention / connections attending a private school. But, if you're looking to meet people with more diverse financial backgrounds, Michigan will likely have the upper hand here.  You'll have experiences in NYU that Michigan won't be able to replicate, and vice-versa. At the end of the day, both will be fun and both will suck. College is what you make of it.   Ross is difficult to get into, so be aware that you might attend the university and not be able to major in what you're interested in. At Stern, this doesn't seem like it'll be the problem.  Good luck. you can't go wrong with your decision.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Assuming your out of state go to Stern
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Echoing others, but if you‚Äôre out of state, go Stern. Missing out on some of the school spirit is worth the level of education and connections you will get at stern and living in NY. As someone who attended NYU, you‚Äôll have to put yourself out there more, but the experience is excellent
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,If you‚Äôre out of state go to stern
post,COVID-19,positive,I just want the school to know that kids are getting vaccinated so they feel comfortable with a fully normal school year next year
comment,COVID-19,neutral,You can indicate in the Blue Queue questionnaire that you don‚Äôt want to receive a vaccine from the university because you have an appointment scheduled elsewhere or already received it. I think this is the only place to communicate this so far. https://umichumhs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8oywy6UbWKIkx4p
comment,COVID-19,positive,If U-M institutes a policy requiring vaccination, as some schools have, then I'm sure they'll let you know what's needed. If they don't, presumably a large minority of the community will forego vaccination, so reassurances aren't necessarily warranted. It should give *you* considerable comfort that you're vaccinated, as well as your family and friends, but for others I'm not sure how much it matters. I'd be more interested in infection rates and variant types around me than vaccination rates. They're certainly related, but we could have 0.1% of the community coughing P.1 around campus this fall, on an ongoing basis, whether 50% are vaccinated or 100% are vaccinated. We'll just have to wait and see how things develop.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a process for it yet.   I guess you could submit the information to be added to your medical record at UHS.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I don't think there will be a way to do it before this semester ends, and for next semester I have no clue.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I just sent a scan of my vaccine card to UHS medical records and they said they added it. Doesn't show up in my vaccine records system but I trust that it's there. UHS-ROIRequest@med.umich.edu  The facility I got it at is on Epic for their medical records too and I see it in my patient portal there, so they might just be able to see them anyway since I think their systems are supposed to talk to each other. I know CVS uses Epic too so if you got it there maybe it'll be the same case. Maybe I'll ask my doctor next time I see them if they can see all that info.   I'm sure at some point the school will ask, but for now that's just what I did for school and general health record keeping purposes.
post,Student Organization,positive,Does anyone know of an active hiking and backpacking club at umich? The clubs I found online all seem inactive or defunct. If there aren‚Äôt any, would anyone be interested in starting or joining one with me?
comment,Student Organization,positive,Hi! There is an active Michigan Backpacking Club on campus: [https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/mbc](https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/mbc)  Last year, I went on an amazing week backpacking trip out to Zion with the club a week before COVID shut everything down. Due to COVID, club activities have been subdued. There were small, weekend walks in the Arb last semester, but I haven't seen much this semester. There's a GroupMe that most of the club is in as well. The club just had elections a week or two ago too. In that link I posted, there is an email for the club.

post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,As the title suggests, I‚Äôm planning on transferring in credit for EECS 203 from an outside university this summer. I was wondering if any of you guys had any recommendations for which community college I could go to in order to do this. I‚Äôve actually already taken EECS 203 but some unfortunate things happened and I have to retake it, so I‚Äôm not worried about content so much as I‚Äôm worried about convenience. Any response is appreciated! Thanks!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I am taking Math 275 at Henry Ford College online right now and it is the easiest class I have taken. Highly recommend.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,I transferred from wayne state and my 203 transferred. I know it‚Äôs not a community college but if you‚Äôre in state I think it‚Äôs still decently cheap. It‚Äôs called CSC 1500 if I‚Äôm not mistaken
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,If you don't care about actually learning then definitely take it at HFC. The teacher there has no clue what he's doing so he makes the class extremely easy and grades very lightly. One time he was confused about how logarithms worked. It also transfers and is relatively inexpensive.

post,Degree,positive,Hello all!  I'm an incoming freshman at UM. I plan to take both econ and cs at LSA. I expect it to be a lot of work, but I was wondering if you guys could shed light on the workload/expected work life balance if I choose these majors. Thank you for helping in advance!
comment,Degree,positive,you should ask yourself why you're already so set on doing both. what career do you hope to have? i'd doubt that it requires a degree in both, to be honest. why not instead come here, take the intro classes for each, and then see if a preference between them emerges? i bet one will.
comment,Degree,positive,I was planning to do both but ended up just doing CS and taking any econ classes I was interested in (I think I'm almost at a minor but not sure). Like the other comment, there are not that many reasons that you would need both majors (the main one I can think of would be if you really wanted to do computationally intensive econ research, but it's extremely niche). Imo the econ classes are much easier than CS, so I think your expected workload would just be a bit more than the average CS major.   Also, I am CSE and also found that many econ classes were made easier by the fact that I had a good understanding of stats/calc, so depending on what you take it could help you.
comment,Degree,neutral,Do CS with an Econ or ross minor
comment,Degree,positive,Just a reminder first that Economics is way different from Finance in Ross, not comparable at all. You‚Äôd be able to take a lot finance electives as a Non-Ross student, though not getting any degree rewarded.   Econ classes are extremely easy if you have a solid foundation of (computational) Calc. Super light workload compared with CS, also GPA booster.  Undergrad Econ is mainly about (Causal effects with Cost Benefit Analysis, Game Theory, Exchange Rate models), i.e almost any undergrad classes here fall into one of the above three category. That said, nearly none of them are directly applicable in real life.   However, Economics trains your critical minds and help you make different kinds of fiends, enriching your social life at Central campus. You may get tired after continuously doing coding work for several years.
comment,Degree,positive,I actually was considering both, so feel free to dm me if you want insight on classes in both majors
post,Student Organization,positive,I got accepted into LSA a couple of months ago and im thinking of attending. Just wondering before I make my final decision are there any secular humanist and atheist clubs?
comment,Student Organization,positive,Google tells me there was a chapter of the Secular Student Alliance, but it doesn‚Äôt seem super active anymore.   In general, Ann Arbor and UMich are very secular. It would be a bigger problem in terms of cultural fit on campus if you were very religious. (But, being a big school, there are niches for that too. Just saying it‚Äôs pretty easy to avoid.)
comment,Student Organization,positive,I don't really think you need (or want) a devoted club for that. Just post on /r/atheist if that's your thing.  You'd be better suited a) taking philosophy and (history of) theology courses and/or b) attending related clubs therein.

comment,Class,positive,Hey there, I have a few questions.  1. 494 is often said to have a high workload. Is this because a lot of time is spent coding or because a lot of time is spent understanding game design concepts? Can you estimate how much of a split there is between these two actions? 2. Not sure if you can answer this, but how much time would you say students spend per week on 494? 3. Will 494 be remote or in-person for the fall? The class size is on the edge of what some might consider to be small or large so I wanted to see if you had anything to say. 4. In the game showcase, projects use technology such as TVs, controllers, etc. Are these provided or do the students have to provide them themselves?  Thank you for your time.

post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Hey has anyone had to ask professors for recommendations for graduate school yet? I don't really know when to ask and can't find any standard timeline online. Also, I haven't really gotten to know any of my professors for the past 1.5 years due to having no in-person classes. I don't really want to go back to freshman year or beginning of sophomore year profs from early requirements classes. At the same time, it feels weird asking for a rec over email and barely knowing the prof.   &#x200B;  I was thinking of asking a professor if they'd be comfortable meeting with me virtually once or twice to see if they'd be down to write me a rec, would this be a good idea? Also, if I'm planning on applying to grad school next year, should I do it by the end of this semester or early next school year?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Now is about the right time. Also, ask them in their virtual office hours (not just sending an email). They'll probably have their gsi write it because your gsi knows you better than they do, but they'll sign it.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I think if you email that you need recs and remind them that the situation with covid has prevented you from getting to know any of them, they might even agree to a request for a 15-30 minute zoom so you can introduce yourself.  I say this as a UM prof

Besides, is there any other courses very similar to EECS281 that can be used to meet CS major requirements? (I'm a current student at UC and anxious to enter desired major ASAP)
comment,Class,positive,I've heard that the department rarely accepts transfer credit to satisfy EECS 281 (though you can surely reach out and check).
comment,Class,neutral,Apparently the only class they let you transfer for 281 is at a Chinese university.
comment,Class,positive,I've heard they rarely grant equivalencies for 281 and even so the 183 --> 280 --> 281 sequence are pretty important as far as I know so you should probably just take it at Michigan

post,Finances,positive,Hello! Recently got admitted for Mech E and U Mich is definitely one of my top choices. HOWEVER, my financial aid package just came out and my tuition is 52k per year with the grant given and 47k per year if I take the default govt loans suggested. As a middle class family, this is wayyyyy too expensive, especially since my sister is also at college.  I still want to go though, so I was wondering if anyone was in a similar situation and if anyone has any advice.  Thanks! :)   \#GoBlue
comment,Finances,positive,Look I am going to be brutally honest. There is no way I would be here if I wasn't an in-state student. Like never would think of coming here. I also don't get anything from financial aid but my parents are also not rich. There is no reason frankly to pay this much. Which college you attended for your Bachelor's degree doesn't have any effect on your career goals and jobs. If I was you, I'd go in-state or somewhere where I won't have to pay the ridiculous amount out of state tuition is. I know you really want to go here but unless you are willing to either wait till you're 24 for financial aid or join a military branch for the financial aid, I wouldn't think too much about michigan. If you really want to come to michigan and those options are not available, student loans are your only hope which SUCKS.

comment,COVID-19,positive,Personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very productive to try to guess what administration will do next. That‚Äôs a bag of cats that just isn‚Äôt predictable or rational based on public information.  Right now Washtenaw has lower case counts and more people vaccinated than the rest of the state. The past week we had a [rapid rise to a plateau](https://www.washtenaw.org/3108/Cases) of about 150 cases/day (scroll down to the chart labeled ‚ÄúPositive Test Results Per Day‚Äù). That ain‚Äôt great, but is about 30-50% lower than the statewide numbers by population. There‚Äôs a similar plateau in the [UM CSTP](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/dashboard/surveillance-testing) numbers (which have been 0.6% positive for the last two weeks).  Will we break out of the current plateau locally and go higher next week? Maybe. There are a lot of dynamics working against us (variants, restaurants open). But the big one we have working in our favor is vaccinations. We‚Äôre at 35% of the population in Washtenaw at >= 1 dose (and the real number may be a bit higher because that doesn‚Äôt count people going to Ohio to get vaccinated). For reference, Israel saw a decline in cases about two weeks after they hit 30% vaccinated (remember it takes two weeks for partial immunity to kick in).

post,Prospective Student,positive,I got admitted into the College of Engineering and UMich earlier this year, and while I'm not committed yet, I will mostly likely be attending next fall (super excited!). I was wondering if there is a first year engineering course or path that exposes you to all the different types of engineering (at the risk of a comparison: similar to Purdue's First Year Engineering program where every engineering major takes the same set of classes their first year and gains exposure to all different engineering areas). I did apply as a Mechanical Engineering major, but to be honest, I haven't had much exposure in many of the engineering areas and am not sure if I'll end up liking something better. It would be great if anyone has any insights! Thanks in advance :)
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Engineering 110 is the course you are looking for.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Also each ENGR 100 (required freshman yr project class) section is a different project in a different engineering area. Take one you are really interested in and it‚Äôll expose you to that area. I took the civil & environmental one just because it sounded interesting and now I switched my major (from biomedical engineering) to environmental engineering!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,You generally won‚Äôt take any major specific courses on a normal freshman schedule, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about being locked in to anything. Also you were just admitted to the college of engineering, whatever you wrote as the intended major on the application is irrelevant.   As someone else said, Engineering 110 is the class you want. It‚Äôs usually a once per week seminar and each week you‚Äôll get a presentation by a different department within the college of engineering and they‚Äôll explain what their major is about, career opportunity, what classes you‚Äôll take, etc.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôd recommend you take ENGR 101 and ENGR 110 first semester. ENGR 110 exposes you to all the Majors in COE. That way you can take ENGR 100 second semester. ENGR 100 has specific sections for different fields so you can pick one that interests you from ENGR 110.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi!  I'm currently a freshman in my second semester at UConn but I was looking to possibly apply to transfer to UMich in the future as a CS major most likely for the Fall 2022 semester. I had a couple question about transferring and would appreciate if anyone would be able to answer them.  1. I know the CS major is available both in LSA and the College of Engineering and I can only apply for one on my application. Would I be allowed to send in two apps, one for each college, to maximize my chances?  2. Are the SOE pre reqs to be completed before I turn in my application or before I come to campus, the last requirement I need is linear algebra but I was planning to take it during the second semester of my sophomore year (in which the final grade for the class will be available three months after the application deadline of Feb 1 2022 presumably).  3. Likewise, I know for LSA you need 50-60 credits if you don't want a lot of emphasis on High School grades and test scores. Are these 50-60 credits to be completed before applying or before coming to campus?  4. Does SOE or LSA accept spring transfers for CS? Is the deadline the same?  5. Are scholarships scarce for transfer students?  6. Any other tips?  I'd be happy to provide any extra info or clarification if needed.  &#x200B;  Thanks in advance for the help!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,3. You can transfer *up to* 60 credits (62 with an Associate's degree). You are not required to have 60 transferable credits.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. Go for LSA since it‚Äôs easier to get in. No essential difference between two colleges in terms of (almost) everything. You may apply internal transfer to engineering school after you arrive here.  2. A single class is never deterministic.  3. I don‚Äôt believe you won‚Äôt have 50-60 credits until the semester before Fall 2022.  4. 5. Yes. Check website for details.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. I don't think so, but you'd have to call the respective admissions offices to check  2. Before you start classes at UofM. You can take them as late as the summer (assuming you're starting in the fall), just make it clear in your application that you have a solid plan to complete all pre-reqs before showing up  3. No idea; I'm in CoE, not LSA  4. Once again, no idea about LSA but for CoE the website only lists application deadlines for fall term (apparently it was March 1) and winter term (Oct 1). Starting in the spring/summer might still be an option, ask the transfer advising office  5. Yes. Really really tough to get merit scholarships at UofM  in general, coming in as a transfer student it's basically impossible. You can still get need based aid, and as a CS student you can get some pretty solid summer internships (whether you're in CoE or LSA, employers generally don't care about the difference)  6. Weird tip, not really application related: if you end up going for CoE, they'll let you choose which credits you want to transfer in. Why would you want to leave some off? Because tuition goes up by about two thousand dollars per semester once you reach 55+ credit hours. So if you're a sophomore with 55 credits, you're gonna be paying like you were a junior. I actually can't speak for CS specifically, but for MechE you really need three years to finish your degree once you transfer in, so even if you have two years already, you're basically a sophomore again. Taking off any useless credits is a good way to save yourself some money. Works for AP classes too, you can just choose not to get the credit, and now that UofM just changed their rules for registration so that AP credits don't help get you an earlier registration date, just toss them and save the money
post,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Took a lighter semester after the absolute fuster cluck that was fall, and ended up not hating myself and being in constant grind. Watched every lecture, did all my homework, and studied before my exams more than I have before. And my return is just still failing everything I‚Äôve put effort into. I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm tired. Fuck COVID and what it‚Äôs done to all of our mental health. I‚Äôm clocked out and looking into transferring and writing an email to my parents.  Good luck everybody else.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I was in the same place 4 years ago. Unless you know exactly what you want to do with life, it may be beneficial to take a few years off, get a job and come back with a different mindset
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Speak with an advisor. Don't give up unless they are kicking you out. I was in a similar position, but talked with one of the ECE advisors and they gave me a lot of great advice. It got me motivated for the following semester and I did awesome.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Based on your profile, it looks like you're in the EECS department and taking CS classes. I just want to point out that the EECS department is BRUTAL and is NOT lenient at all. Their policies are strict and are not geared towards supporting their students. Their "rigorous" programs are the reason they're highly ranked. Combine this with virtual classes and it's a shitshow all around. If you're first-gen, low SES, have mental/physical illnesses, or have any sort of disadvantaged background, you're basically fucked in the EECS department. I'm sorry you've had such a terrible experience at Michigan, but I promise it's not any fault of your own and you're experience is more common than you think. This university and especially the EECS department does a terrible job at ensuring the success of their students.   I'm going to suggest you reach out to professors/advisors that actually care about their students. It helps to talk to someone that actually wants to help you. I recommend speaking to Mark Brehob or Wes Weimer if you can. For more general issues, I recommend Leanne in the CSP office.   I promise it does get better, and you're not alone. There's people out there that can help you. Whether or not you decide to transfer is ultimately up to you, but I want you to consider whether or not you'll have the same issues you have now at a different university. If you struggle with CS classes now, how much easier are they going to be at different university? If you struggle with mental health now, what are the chances that your mental health will be an issue at a different university? Will another university have sufficient resources to support you? Is uprooting your life and transferring to a different university going to solve all your problems?  Would you benefit more from learning how to better manage your mental health and the stress of classes? Finding the right combination of adequate exercise, sleep, healthy food, therapy, meds, etc. can be monumental to your success at a competitive university. Knowing when to take an L to take care of your well-being can prevent you from completely burning out. Remember some EECS classes you just have to pass and move on with your life (especially 203/376). Reaching out to professors is incredibly uncomfortable but they're the ones that can help you pass your classes. You don't have to do it all on your own.  I'm not saying you shouldn't take a semester off and figure out your life but be careful making decisions that you might not be happy with later. Whatever you decide, I wish you well and I hope you find your path!   (I'm sorry I got a little out of hand and wrote a lot)
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,:-((( i‚Äôm really sorry this semester and the previous one were really challenging and awful for you . . . i hope you‚Äôre able to have a happier uni life and that your email goes well!!  i wish you the best!!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,It's a GODAWFUL year.  Only you know everything that makes up the context of your current decision, but know this:  failing is not necessarily a sign that you should bow out at UM.
post,Class,negative,I‚Äôm plan on taking a class over the spring/ summer term, but it has the prerequisite for a class that I‚Äôm currently taking. However, I‚Äôm plan on dropping that prerequisite class before the 4/21 drop deadline.   So my question is: if I drop that prerequisite class after registration, is the system going to drop the class that has the prerequisite? Or there‚Äôs a loophole in the system??   Anyone had similar experiences mind to share?
comment,Class,negative,No, the system won‚Äôt drop any class that you‚Äôve registered. It‚Äôs a loophole.   I know a guy who registered Econ 401 in the spring. He also registered several 400-level Econ classes in the subsequent fall. But he dropped 401 the spring but continued to take those 400 level Econ classes in that fall.

post,Housing,positive,I'm think of waiting until the summer to sign a lease so I can actually visit Ann Arbor and see which apartments I like. Does housing typically get reserved out early in the year? Looking for a single bedroom. Thanks!
comment,Housing,negative,You shouldn‚Äôt wait to summer You‚Äôll have little to no options Returning students usually re-sign their leases or sign new leases in January   A lot of admitted grad students start finding housing shortly after their admission. Most leases in Ann Arbor near the university begin in may or august but get signed well in advanced   A majority of the housing options near north campus either aren‚Äôt one bedroom or in weird locations at a high price  So ultimately you‚Äôll get some sort of housing if you wait but it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll have very few options to choose from and likely won‚Äôt get all your wants. You‚Äôll probably loose out on proximity to campus if you want to live alone or vice versa if being close matters more you‚Äôll get stuck with roommates

post,Research,neutral,title basically is the question, when should i start emailing labs about research positions
comment,Research,positive,you can start now, it will depend on the lab. I think the best thing with finding a lab is to just reach out to as many as possible since it's a numbers game. Maybe do a round now and then also do a round in August, and you can try again once the semester starts if you haven't found anything.
comment,Research,neutral,I would start now! I work in a lab in psychiatry and we are planning for fall and summer now
comment,Research,neutral,Now if you haven't started already.
comment,Research,neutral,I‚Äôve been emailing all year and finally got an offer just this week, I would start emailing now !!
comment,Research,neutral,Grad student in psych. Our lab already has a waitlist of ~30. Do it now !
post,Miscellaneous,neutral,I need to take anatomy and physiology (both I and II over the summer), and need  to take them at a community college. I tried washtenaw  but it seems like they only have one course and don‚Äôt offer both. Does anyone know any where I could take these classes (that aren‚Äôt crazy expensive)?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,You can search the transfer credit equivalency tool [here](https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu/), and search by state of college and course number at UofM. (U-M Course tab at top)
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Try Schoolcraft College?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,>tried washtenaw  but it seems like they only have one course and don‚Äôt offer both  Did you talk to someone there?  My imagine, without any further details in the post, is either they're not offering it because of staff, resources, etc., or it may not transfer.  WCC (where I went for a year) does a great job of working with the university regarding courses and transfers.
post,Class,positive,I'm a CS junior and I'm graduating next semester. I've always taken close to the max credits allowed, but next semester I will need 4 credits to graduate and plan on taking just that. Have any of you had luck trying to unofficially attend or follow along with EECS classes? Can I just email the professor asking if I can get access to the canvas?
comment,Class,positive,Try looking into what‚Äôs called an audit. I don‚Äôt know the details of it, but last year a kid in his last semester just sat along in a class of mine and learned the material and got access to all the resources without taking it for any exams or doing it for grade or credit.
comment,Class,positive,I think you would have better luck finding a friend that's taking the class you want to follow along with and ask them if you can use their canvas. A lot of eecs classes have websites instead of using canvas so you can google a bunch of classes you're interested in. If classes are in-person in the fall, you can just show up and watch but this is unlikely since eecs classes are very large and probably won't be in-person. I've never tried asking a professor if I can access canvas so hopefully someone else can chime in.
post,New Student,positive,I got accepted to the college of engineering and I plan on majoring in computer engineering. Only problem is that my high school doesn‚Äôt have a physics class. the admissions office advised that I ‚Äútake physics before the fall 2021 semester‚Äù. Does anyone know exactly which physics courses I should take? Does this mean I need to register for a physics class at a community college? Or just watch an intro to physics video on YouTube? Any advice is appreciated
comment,New Student,positive,Because you‚Äôre planning on CE, I don‚Äôt think an intro physics class is super important for further learning. Physics 140 will be a tough first go at physics though if you‚Äôve never seen the concepts before. If you could easily take a Community college course and transfer that credit in for physics 140, I think that‚Äôs be a good idea. If not, not a huge deal, but expect to be challenged in that class.
comment,New Student,positive,I think they just kinda say that. Once you're accepted, there's no burden on you to take any extra classes for admission. CoE has a physics 140/1 and 240/1 requirements mechanics and E&M. SO you'll be fine doing your requirements at college if you want. I'd suggest you take 140/1 at CC just cause it's easier and the grade won't transfer.
comment,New Student,neutral,Take a physics class in the summer at a cc
comment,New Student,positive,Yeah just take physics in cc this summer. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. Make sure you‚Äôre able to transfer the credit over though, so talk to your school counselor or admissions rep from umich on where u should go this summer.
comment,New Student,positive,WCC has an intro physics class that‚Äôs similar to HS physics or they have a transfer equivalent to 140. Depends on your comfort level with calculus & science.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Gonna make this post short and sweet:  Today I was accepted as a transfer into U-M Flint. I ultimately want to transfer to the U-M School of Kinesiology at Ann Arbor to pursue a bachelor's degree in Sport Management.   What kind of GPA do I need to achieve at Flint to have a good shot at getting in? Can anyone speak from experience or share experiences they know of?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Two completely different schools. Good luck! üçÄ
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As a Dearborn->AA transfer...  If you‚Äôre trying to transfer into Ann Arbor I would say nothing less than a 3.5, especially since you‚Äôre at a less competitive school - top 10% at Dearborn is middling in Ann Arbor  If you‚Äôve already transferred from another institution to Flint, I‚Äôm wondering what benefit you‚Äôll get by transferring again and what costs you‚Äôre incurring. Even within UM, you‚Äôre usually losing some credits when you transfer  But student testimonials aren‚Äôt really useful. Contact an admissions officer. There are events on the main campus that are held specifically for people interested in transferring
post,Research,neutral,I‚Äôm thinking about staying in Ann Arbor during the summer and I‚Äôm trying to find things I can do. Also is work-study applicable here, or is that only during the actual semester or something
comment,Research,neutral,There might still be some positions left open, but you should hurry
comment,Research,positive,I‚Äôm pretty sure work-study doesn‚Äôt apply if you‚Äôre not, you know, studying.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I just got in to RD Michigan Ann Arbor! Although I am excited, I still am deciding whether or not I want to attend. A big factor is money, and it seems like I can only view financial aid after accepting my Michigan offer. The problem is my decision would rely on financial aid info then, is there any way to create a Uniqname without accepting the offer.

post,Prospective Student,positive,If you get into LSA but not Ross Can you still take classes like finance or do you have to transfer into Ross. Should you just change your major to something else you like and stick it out and get an MBA or just not go at all???
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Here is a list of finance classess which non-ross students can take, (Fin 302, 317, 342, 408-409, 415, 412-414, 428, 475). That said, after Fin 302 (making financial decisions), the core finance class in Ross, you can gain access to a bunch of advanced finance classes. Some requires override permissions but you'll get them if you do well in Fin 302.  Some other classes such as Acctg 471 should also be open to Non-Ross kids and I've taken most of them in my early college when I was still looking for jobs. (I‚Äôm in LSA); Feel free to PM me if you want to know more information.  However, some specially desgined classes for IB such as financial trading (Fin 440) won't be open to you.
post,New Student,negative,I don't know what to do. I'm an in-state freshman, completely relying on them financially, have only a few hundred in my savings, and no scholarships. The reason why they might disown is because I want to major in history and become a teacher, but my dad thinks that I am going to 'destroy' the family legacy and wants to disown me because I am 'hurting' his reputation. I suck at math and econ, and I find no joy from studying it. I don't want to pursue his plan and realize in my late 30s that it's too late. He said if I want to pursue my passion you will have zero funds after this semester is over. I feel like I have nowhere to go. I have no friends because all my high school friends are in Lansing (MSU) or out of state. I'm just shattered, and I don't know how UofM can support me. I come from a upper middle class background, and I just am scared.
comment,New Student,positive,This is an oof.   Sounds like something very similar my dad went though. My grandpa told him "you will major in economics and then go straight to law school". My dad did exactly that as my grandpa was paying for his college.   He did well, found some joy and ultimately his niche in that career. But even though his path lead to success, he's always said to me to " pursue what I wanted as you only get one life to live - don't waste it doing something you don't want to do as you'll have to do it 40hrs a week for the next 40 or so years - the money doesn't matter. While I (my dad) wasn't given the choice, I made a living doing this so that you could."  Idk, maybe you'll find inspiration from that, maybe you won't. But it's a common situation. The hard part is figuring out which part you want to play.
comment,New Student,positive,If I am you, I would double econ and history major. Econ major requires 30 credits. Double major is very usual. You can tell you parents  you are econ student (take history major at the same time). In umich, course selection is very flexible. You can make you econ major be not quantitative.
comment,New Student,positive,I‚Äôm a mom of a freshman (at another school) - talk to your parents.  Calmly.  Explain yourself.  Then; give them time.     As a mom; all I want is for my child to be happy and well.  Sometimes we need a minute to really hear you.  In the meantime, Freshman year is tough; and with the covid restrictions it‚Äôs even more lonely.    Can you talk to your RA and see if there is a counseling center on campus to help you put your thoughts in order?   Hang in there.  Hydrate and get some solid sleep!
comment,New Student,positive,First of all, you absolutely do not deserve this whatsoever. Your degree and your life plan belong to you, and I'm so proud of you for staking a claim in your own happiness. That's fucking brave.   EDIT: THIS IS FOR IF YOU DO GET DISOWNED. It won't be relevant if things are able to resolve peacefully, which is always preferable. (Sorry, hit enter before clarifying this.)  Second of all, it wasn't with my parents, but when I was a sophomore, my life also, for lack of a better term, completely fell apart. I wasn't safe at home, I'd just been diagnosed with a lifelong illness, and I had rent due in three days and $15 to my name from financial abuse. All of this advice, here on, is from my personal experience, so please don't take anything that doesn't resonate. (If it helps, I'm graduating this term from the Honors College).   Screenshot everything. For most University processes and appeals, you're going to need evidence. And, get really comfy with the word "crisis," because that word opens up so many UM doors. (Like, I got to take a week off of school with no consequences because of the "Crisis Team".)  Then, I'd try reaching out to both the Dean of Students' Office and the Blavin Scholars Office. Both work directly with students facing crisis situations and housing/financial instability, and might be able to help at least guide you to the resources that you need for the immediate future. Emergency funds exist (though they may be cramped down right now because of COVID) and they can at least help you prep for housing costs, switching phone plans, etc.   After that, I'd call financial aid, explain the situation, and ask to re-submit your documents as an independent for an appeal. This would exclude your parents' income and will result in some need-based scholarships that could at least help to cover some of tuition (unless you personally own a massive amount of stocks/work at a Fortune 500 while in college, which isn't likely).   Finally, email your professors. You don't have to give specifics, but explain that there is currently a 'family crisis' and that your asssignments for the near future may be late as a result. If you get them all in on-time, props to you, but when my life fell apart, it was nice to have the wiggle room. If the profs ask for documentation, say that you're 'not comfortable sharing intimate family details, but would instead really appreciate grace at this really difficult time.' If you're already working with Dean of Students/Blavin/someone else, say that. It'll help.   It's going to be okay and you're so fucking strong.
comment,New Student,neutral,I'm hoping they're just trying to scare you into doing what they want, but you probably know your parents enough to tell whether that's likely.
comment,New Student,neutral,My recommendation is to not go to UM for an education degree. Go to a much cheaper school for that same quality education. There‚Äôs no reason to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars more on the exact same degree. But anyway, fuck your parents, do whatever makes you happy.
comment,New Student,positive,College is a huge investment. It doesn't make sense for your parents to pay the kind of money UMich requires if they're not going to see a reasonable return on your investment.  If you want to be a teacher, you should talk to people at the School of Education about the pathways for doing so. It's not just getting a random LSA major and then looking for a job - there's an actual certification process. You should also be aware that it's never going to bring significant wealth, there isn't much autonomy and you may find dealing with children all day long wearisome. In any case, a school like UMich may not be the best fit if your goal is to teach at this level - there are cheaper ways to accomplish that goal.  If you want to become a *professor* in History, I'd urge you to talk to your actual professors in History about the career prospects. Statistically, it's up there with "hope my garage band hits it big" as a sensible career plan.  In any case, most people in your situation are really just having a communication disconnect. It's not that your parents want to force you to do something you don't want to do. It's that they want you to have an actual *plan* that doesn't needlessly fritter away their money. When you approach them with a vague "this is what I feel" notion rather than a well-researched set of reasonable goals, you're not giving them any confidence that their money is being well-spent.
comment,New Student,positive,OP, i've been in your exact postion. Parents wanted me to study engineering and something STEM related that would "make a lot of money."   I ended up going in on my own. I wanted to become a German studies professor. I became a German major against their will and transferred to LSA. I picked up a second major in Earth and Environmental Sciences. I currently do engineering work for a German based Environmental company, ironically. But for the mean time this is fine and I will go back to grad school in the next couple years.   I think what other people have said here is correct. You need to try and open a dialogue with them. It is important to communicate your needs and show that what you want is what YOU want. Not what they want. The last thing you want to do is get stuck in a career that you hate. I don't blame you for that. If you love what you do and have a passion for it you can be successful. It's much more rewarding to be doing a job every day that you enjoy rather than one that gives you money. In the end of your life are you going to be thinking on your deathbed that you were happy you made a lot of money or that you did what you wanted and made a difference in that area? I think the choice is clear. When there is a will there is a way.   I know it's not easy to open this channel of communication with your parents. But the fact is that you're an adult now. You get to make choices for yourself. This is your life. Do what YOU want with it. I had a major pep talk from a mentor of mine and this is exactly what he had told me and I stuck to it ever since and pushed my education in my own direction and it all ended up fine.   One last thing is that studying history and the humanities is a noble pursuit in my eyes. It is just as important as the Econ and Math majors out there. It is intellectually challenging and forces you to provide a way of thinking in this world that's important for future generations. Don't let anyone tell you that's a waste of time. Fuck that.
comment,New Student,negative,Piss him off more and get a ROTC scholarship. Full tuition plus a stipend. You may have to defer teaching for a few years after graduation, but it's not a bad move.
comment,New Student,neutral,If I were you I would just finish up all my general education requirements next year to give myself more time, and that way I could choose whatever pathway
comment,New Student,positive,This sounds rough and I'm so sorry your parents are putting you through this. I think it would be best if you and your parents compromised on your plan. Like others mentioned, it's very common for LSA students to double major. I'm not sure what your parents want you to major in but I think these majors might be approved by your parents and they sort of lean towards the social sciences: Economics, Organizational Studies, and Biology, Health, and Society. Pick one of those 3 that your parents approve of then you can double major in History.   And tbh you don't even have to tell them that you're double majoring. Just tell them the major that they want to hear so that they don't get upset at you and cut you off.   Others mentioned the 5th year masters program to get your teaching certificate and I think this would be a solid plan of action. Even if your parents don't fund the 5th year, you have 4 years to figure out how to pay for the 5th yr or taking out loans is also an option.   At the end of the day, you have to do what makes you happy without harming your quality of life. Only you can decide how to weigh the pros/cons of each option. I wish you the best OP.
comment,New Student,positive,I was in this exact same situation except swap history with CS and they kicked me out of the house (remote). Reach out for resources. I slept on a high school friend‚Äôs couch for a while. There are resources for money for food from the school. I‚Äôll update when/if I find it. $45 a week or something. There‚Äôs also like grocery system for poorer students. My friends‚Äô parents ended up talking them down. Just try and be reasonable and a lot of adults will listen. A night of thought might make a world of difference.
comment,New Student,positive,You do not deserve this situation but I can offer one piece of advice that I know many of my friends wish they had taken. I can't get financial aid and I'm assuming you can not either so my main recommendation is DON'T TAKE EXCESSIVE LOANS NO MATTER WHAT. Check with the education school at michigan for your options to becoming a teacher because there are probably better ways than an LSA degree. If you can't work things out with your family such as a dual major in econ and teaching/history. FIND FINANCIAL HELP such as an ROTC scholarship, other military scholarship, wait till you're 24 to finish your degree (can be independent from parent income aka financial aid will fully cover your costs). WHATEVER YOU DO, DONT BURY YOURSELF IN DEBT. DEBT will ruin your life trust me and the many people in my family struggling with student loans. I really wish you the best both mentally and financially.
comment,New Student,positive,In terms of the friends thing, there are so many out-of-state/international students waiting for other freshman to stop defaulting to hanging out with people from high school. Covid sucks, but you‚Äôll find some worthwhile friends if you put yourself out there. Best of luck!
comment,New Student,negative,I put myself through undergrad with only an $8K scholarship and no financial support from anyone.  It sucked (lived in a horrible apartment, worked 3 jobs, didn't sleep much for a few years) but it can be done -- meaning going to Michigan and studying what you want.
comment,New Student,positive,You're dad is trying to live vicariously through you. You are an adult. Have a respectful conversation about how this is what you want to do and this is where you want to be.   If they wont budge, then you have a decision to make. Do what makes you happy. Their love towards you shouldnt depend on your career.  Wish you the best of luck.
comment,New Student,neutral,You‚Äôre in state so your tuition and fees for your 4 years here won‚Äôt be tragic. It‚Äôs ok to sever financial ties and take out loans to do what you want with your life. I realize it feels so overwhelming now, but you‚Äôll be so much happier and again 20-30k of loans isn‚Äôt gonna destroy your future
comment,New Student,positive,Tell your dad to be quiet! Do what you want; however, make sure you have a plan after college. History majors don‚Äôt have access to a ton of good paying jobs, so try to form as many connections as possible to potential job opportunities before your time in college is up. It‚Äôll be a lot of work, but it‚Äôs worth it. Also, double majoring isn‚Äôt a bad idea in something like economics or business. Good luck!

post,Prospective Student,positive,Just got into UMich College of Engineering which I'm super happy about. It's my first choice at the moment. I want to Declare a CS major, however, I've heard that some people in UMich can't get the electives or even the major they want because of too many applicants.   I'm probably choosing between CS at UCSD where I'd be getting a guaranteed admit to a CS program or UMich where I'm only getting into the College Of Engineering and I'm not sure if I'll get into CS.   Is the risk too high? One Quora Post from a UMich CS grad said it was pretty easy to get CS once you got into the College of Engineering, however, I also read an article from The Michigan Daily  about how it can be hard to get the upper level CS classes that you want. Given that the article from the school is more recent I'm concerned that I might not get the classes or even the degree I would prefer once I've committed.   I've read the basic requirements of how I need to maintain a 2.0 or higher in some entry level classes such as Calculus, Physics and Chemistry. I'm confident I can meet those requirements since I've done well (all 5s) in AP Calc, Phys, Chem and CSA but I don't want to risk going to a school and then not getting my first choice major.   Could someone tell me whether it's safe to go for UMich College of Engineering? It's my first choice given the schools I've currently gotten accepted to, however, if there's issues with not being able to get the classes you want to the point where it would impact my education, I'll probably go with the safer choices.   Michigan Daily Article: [https://www.michigandaily.com/academics/students-discuss-frustrations-long-waitlists-upper-level-computer-science-classes/](https://www.michigandaily.com/academics/students-discuss-frustrations-long-waitlists-upper-level-computer-science-classes/)  Quora Post from UMich CS Grad: [https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-get-into-UMich-CS-engineering](https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-get-into-UMich-CS-engineering)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UM definitely does not restrict majors once you are accepted to the college of engineering. If you want to do CS and you complete the prerequisites, you will be allowed to declare CS.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You‚Äôll get the classes you *need* to earn a CS degree.   Depending on your registration priority, you may not always get the exact classes you *want*. That could be the class as a whole, or a section at a certain time of day or taught by a certain instructor. It isn‚Äôt the end of the world most of the time.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,You can be whatever major you want. There‚Äôs no application. The problem is that there are a TON of CS students and not enough seats in every class for every one of them.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'll tell you straight up it's very easy to declare dont worry at all. For classes, everyone gets the core ones. Some popular electives are a bit more crowded but it's not that big of a deal. If not one semester, you'll get em the next.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You will absolutely be able to declare CS (given that you fulfill the prerequisites, which is a specific GPA for two classes and a few intro classes). There's no hard cap on the number of CS majors.  &#x200B;  It's true that we have a CS enrollment problem, and that usually manifests in most students not being able to choose the Upper Level CS electives they want every semester. You will get enough to graduate, but they may not be the ones you desire the most.   &#x200B;  TL; DR: you will get the major you want, but maybe not the exact classes.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You‚Äôll definitely be able to study CS no matter what since there‚Äôs no enrollment limits in CS Department but because of that the EECS department is really stretched thin so you‚Äôre less likely to get into upper level classes.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,There are no formal restrictions per se for CS majors, however, do expect the so-called "weeder classes" such as MATH 115, MATH 116, MATH 215, EECS 203, and EECS 280 that have crazy enrollment numbers to be absolutely brutal. (Check [Atlas](https://atlas.ai.umich.edu) to see what I'm talking about.) The university's (unspoken) tactics are basically to use these introductory courses to "scare" freshmen and sophomores away who are only half-heartedly interested in the field.   However, all of the above is only to give you another perspective on things. Given what it takes to be admitted outright to Illinois CS, I'm pretty sure you will do fine.
post,Food / Culture,positive,  What are the options for living gluten free on campus? Is it better to do a meal plan or is there a better alternative? What are your experiences
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Accommodations might be different for a dietary preference vs. an allergy.   When I was a RA, one of my residents had pretty severe Celiac disease. She let the dining manager at Markley know, and they prepared a special tray for her for every meal she wanted to eat there. And I think she had access to a gluten free pantry at Hill Dining Center in MoJo. She seemed happy with the arrangement.   https://dining.umich.edu/about-our-food/allergies-special-diets/

comment,Social,positive,https://www.umcycling.org/ for when campus opens up, club organizes group rides and stuff. Nothing is allowed atm cause of COVID, but hopefully club sports lets people do things in the fall.  The best ~20 mile route is to go Dexter out and back via huron river drive. Probably the most beautiful stretch of road once fall colors hit. Chelsea out and back via HRD->dexter/chelsea is ~30 depending on where in A2 you are.   I recommend not taking N Main st to get to HRD but instead taking the neighborhood roads by Forsythe middle to Newport road which takes you to HRD.  If you want some routes I can PM you a couple strava routes I have

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi everyone! I've been trying to decide where to apply next year (current junior) and I've pretty much landed on the idea that I'll apply mostly to microbiology programs (or bio, depending on if the uni has a microbiology major specifically) plus U-M MT since it's the only MT program I'd actually go to if I got in (yes I know it's a long shot). However, I was recently thinking about it and was wondering if it would be possible to do both microbiology and MT at Michigan?   I know SMTD/LSA dual degrees are somewhat common (Jazz + Math is a combo I seem to see a lot) but I'm wondering how feasible it is with MT specifically since I've seen a lot of people talking about how huge the time commitment is for BFA MT.   Thanks so much in advance!! <3  TLDR: how feasible is it to do Microbiology and Musical Theatre dual degree at U-M
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Typically MTs don‚Äôt dual major There‚Äôs so many requirements like voice lessons that are things you need to do but aren‚Äôt class per say  Not saying you can‚Äôt but I‚Äôm saying the prospect of it is unlikely
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The MT program at Michigan usually has students that have a shot at Broadway. I think they expect a really intense level of commitment and you probably wouldn‚Äôt be very happy there if you weren‚Äôt all in.

post,Satellite Campus,positive,I got a scholarship at uofm dearborn, but knowing that Ann Arbor is better, should I complete my 4 years and then do my masters at Ann arbor, or do I do my first 2 years and transfer to Ann Arbor, because going to uofm dearborn seems much better than Henry Ford. And I can't go directly in my first year for financial reasons, so what would you recommend?
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,UMich Ann Arbor gives really good financial aid to those who have a demonstrated need for it. I would wait until you see what need based aid you‚Äôre given before deciding.  If you already got your financial aid report, then someone else would be better at comparing the two campuses. On one hand, UMich Ann Arbor is an amazing school with top tier professors and classes and a very social student body. Dearborn may lack in some of those aspects, but it may be worth it financially.
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,I went to Dearborn for a year and a half until I transferred to Ann Arbor this semester. I would say that Dearborn seriously lacked a certain feeling of like living on campus and being social. Not a lot of people really went to events cause the school is mostly for commuter students from home. I lived in the on campus apartments and they were okay but still a lack of socializing among the people living there. I think the price is good and I enjoyed most of my classes while at Dearborn. If you want to save money I would definitely probably go to Dearborn especially if you have a scholarship. I got great financial aid at Dearborn as well, but this semester at Ann Arbor I actually barely got any aid so that might be something to consider but I think it may also be because of the fact that I transferred in the winter semester.
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,It should be noted that UM Dearborn and UM Ann Arbor are two completely different schools. They used to collaborate and auto-accept cross-school transferring, but those days have long since passed. These days, the similarities begin and end with the name.  UM Ann Arbor is the much larger school, with a much higher ranking and standing in academia. A degree from UM Ann Arbor will carry far more weight than one from Dearborn. In addition, UM Ann Arbor has far better opportunities for its students, both in employment and in grad school applications.

comment,Student Organization,positive,While the picture is an absolute beaut, the main purpose of this computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is to model convective heating, drag, and shockwave behavior around TSM! This allows us to better understand the way our rocket interacts with the air throughout flight, and informs our designs accordingly.  This simulation was run on the university's supercomputer, Great Lakes, via ANSYS Fluent. We also got a few more views that will help us understand the rocket at this state, like the heat of the air near the rocket.  That obstruction on the mid-right is the plow (top) of the lower raceway (the pipe that takes fluids and wires from the upper tank to the engine).

post,Sports,positive,He seems to be playing well at Miami. Honestly disappointed that all he is used for is just threes. If he has space, he'll shoot. If he doesn't, he'll pass it away.  Sometimes the defense has already covered him out to the point where he can't really gets a shot off. So in that case he's useless. He doesn't really drive in to the rim because he's not a great finisher. Or maybe spo doesn't want him to. His defense is meh, commits a lot of silly fouls.  I initially thought maybe he could be like a poor man's Klay Thompson. Maybe that's his ceiling.  How good do you think he can be? How will his career end up?
comment,Sports,positive,Yeah I think poor man‚Äôs Ray Allen at best but that‚Äôs still a really good role player
comment,Sports,positive,hes just gonna be a really good shooter
comment,Sports,positive,Might want to post this in /r/MichiganWolverines as well, since it's more related to what you're asking about.
comment,Sports,positive,If he played slightly above average defense, he would be the perfect player in today‚Äôs nba. We‚Äôve already seen he can play an important role on a contender. If he improves his defense, his ceiling is a poor mans klay. If he stays the exact same, he‚Äôll probably just be Kyle Korver 2.0.
post,Miscellaneous,negative,I am curious about whether this is plausible or possible. With everything going on with the calls for resignation and recent Board of Regents meeting, I started to wonder about what would happen to the building:   1. If he resigns  2. If he doesn‚Äôt resign.  I think it‚Äôs disgraceful and disgusting to have campus buildings named for him at this point and as the naming rights were part of donations, I‚Äôm wondering if this can even be changed. Instead of being named after a renowned Physicist (Dennison)....we have campus building named for this joke of an individual.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,For anyone who is curious, as part of the bicentennial a committee prepared updated guidelines for how the university should name facilities and also if/when renaming requests should be considered.   [A shorter summary article is here from the University Record.](https://record.umich.edu/articles/u-m-defines-principles-process-building-renaming-requests/)  [You can read the full committee recommendations here.](http://president.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/01/Regents-2008-Naming-Policy-and-Guidelines.pdf)  Edit: I will also add that these sorts of changes typically happen very slowly. C.C. Little's support of eugenics was no secret but it took a long time, protests, and an educational campaign to build momentum for a change. I devoured university history as an undergrad but even then didn't know about this because I never looked further than 'Former UM President'.   I would be interested to survey students and see if they know who the buildings they spend the most time are named for and that person's connection to the university. In some cases I think it's sort of built into the experience of being in the building (the FXB comes to mind). But do many Econ students know who Emil Lorch was? Is Erastus Haven a familiar name to PoliSci majors?   Having this involve a donor, particularly a living one with active connections to the university, adds a bunch of other layers. There were calls to rename the business school every time Stephen Ross' support of Trump came into the news, but nothing ever sustained. And not saying you have to like it or agree with it, but when you've given nearly half a billion to the university nobody is going to move quickly to take his name off of buildings.   They aren't the same thing but there is some history of university donors with named buildings engaging in less than savory activity and no formal action taken by the university (see: Sam Wyly and Alfred Taubman).
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Weiser who? I know of no such building. Dennison for life.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,I'm still disgusted by the Regents' decision to remove the name of a brilliant physicist - [David Dennison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Dennison) \- to replace it with the name of a glorified slumlord because he donated a bunch of money. The recent statements and actions of Weiser show just how poor of a decision this was. Shame on the University of Michigan Board of Regents for bowing to money over actual contributions to science. Utterly disgusting.  If anyone knows of a petition to undo this wrong, please point the way. In the mean time, $50 million, $100 million, however-the-fuck-much million dollars isn't enough to get me to call 500 Church Street anything other than the Dennison Building.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Oh who gives a damn, don't people have more important things to worry about than building names?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,For context, [mlive](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2014/12/mckinley_founder_ron_weiser_do.html) reported in 2014 that the Weisers donated $50 million, which "earned them naming rights to the Dennison Building", just after regents approved $49 million in renovations to the building. It brought the Weisers total donations to the university to $95.9 million, while a more [recent article](https://www.wjhl.com/news/politics/michigan-board-censures-gop-regent-for-witches-comment/) put their total donations at more than $120 million. A [Michigan Daily article](https://www.michigandaily.com/uncategorized/honor-50-million-donation-regents-rename-dennison-building/) said naming the building was "in recognition" of the $50 million donation, but did not mention "naming rights" like mlive did.  So far a [gofundme](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2014/12/mckinley_founder_ron_weiser_do.html) for renaming rights to the building has raised $1,240 of its $1,800 goal, but that was not put up by the university.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,You have to donate millions to the school if you want it renamed.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi there! I just got into UMich and Carnegie Mellon and I'm planning to study mechanical engineering. I'm having a lot of trouble deciding, so I have a few questions y'all might be able to help me with:  1. One of the biggest differences between UMich and CMU seems to be their size - is getting classes you want really difficult? Is it still possible to talk to professors/get involved with research, or does that just not happen if the classes are too big? Is it harder to make good friends at a big school? 2. What's the workload like? 3. I heard MechE is super unbalanced in terms of gender.. have any women in STEM found this to be a problem?  Overall, I think I'm leaning towards UMich rn because the academics are great and I love the big sports/school spirit vibe (I play basketball so I'm really into that) but I'm kinda hesitant about the size of the school. Would love some advice! Thanks in advance!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Carnegie Melon, not Central Michigan, right?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,RE: Women in STEM  I‚Äôm a girls girl. I majored in another engineering field. The gender gap bothered me at first, but I found community by being really active in a student organization meant for women in engineering. Those were ‚Äúmy people‚Äù and we had classes together, lived together, etc. - years later, they‚Äôre still my close friends and we‚Äôve been in each others weddings.   You could consider WISErp the Michigan Leaning Community (special dorm), Society of Women Engineers, Phi Sigma Rho, or a variety of other student orgs to make your engineering community more female than the CoE as a whole. Joining these things also helps a big school feel smaller.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Honestly was in the same situation as you three years ago. The difference between the two was the campus. I didn't like the location/look of cmu's campus as much. This wasn't a deciding factor for me, but cost is another thing to definitely consider. You'll get similar quality of education at both schools. Although, I have a friend who goes there, and he said he is enjoying it. I think it is definitely a subjective decision for you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm not in engineering, but in general, getting the classes I want hasn't been difficult at all. There are tons of opportunities for research here (so many you'll be like which one do I pick lol), but you will have to be the one to approach profs. Honestly, the large class sizes don't bother me because once you find a few other people you can always ask/answer each other's questions and work together on problem sets. Also, go to office hours whenever you have questions! I feel like this is very underutilized by students, but has been instrumental to my performance in several STEM classes.   I wish I could help with your other 2 questions, but I simply don't enough to. Hope this helps!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Are you in state for Michigan? That would make a huge difference later.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Got waitlisted by Ross for one of their one-year masters programs. Feeling a little bit disappointed as they reached their decision so late in the semester. Would have been nice to know of this a bit sooner, as many grad program deadlines have come and gone. Given the opportunity, I‚Äôm going to look into applying to more schools as backups in case of being rejected.   So, as some advice for many of you applying to grad schools later in your academic career, don‚Äôt place all your eggs in one basket, reach out to more schools earlier in their cycle, and apply as soon as you can so there is more room in admission classes! Also, Having more extracurriculars than your supposed competitors also is a MAJOR factor, as I was someone without them due to covid and financial capability.  Thanks for coming to my tedtalk!

post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Hi all. From what I have seen, Calc 4 at UMich sounds quite scary. I'm just about to finish off Calc 2 and I was thinking about taking Calc 4 at Washtenaw. I guess it is a new policy at Washtenaw that you do not have to take courses in order. I know at UMich you can take 216 before 215, but has anyone taken MATH 295 before 293 at Washtenaw? Do they build off of eachother at all? Thanks!  Followup would I be behind on UMich math 216 if I took Calc 3 at Washtenaw?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I took both MTH 293 and 295 at WCC. They definitely build off each other to an extent (vectors and matrices and such) and I think it‚Äôd make 295 much easier if you take 293 first, but it wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world if you took 295 first. My prof made 295 much easier by reviewing the 293 material needed in case people didn‚Äôt take 293 beforehand, but I know that not every prof does that
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I‚Äôm gonna be honest, I don‚Äôt think I learned a thing taking 293 at WCC, and I did 295 quite easily. If you can, take 295 with Alan Orrick. Great professor.

post,Housing,positive,Ok weird context but basically I will be living on campus next year but not in dorms or anything. I have a way to live in an apartment which is essentially just as close as any dorms. By doing this I will save some money but will I be losing the "first year experience" even though I am on campus?
comment,Housing,positive,I did this this year because I knew everyone would be send home part way through the year and I wanted secure housing because I am unable to live at home due to some circumstances.   I would say that I do feel like I missed out a little bit, but not as much as a normal year. Though I did meet people living in dorms, after they got sent home I didn‚Äôt stay in touch with them and only stayed friends with people who stayed on campus.   But, I made stronger connections with people that I met through clubs and orgs because we shared stuff in common, they aren‚Äôt just random people that happened to be in the same hall as me or something in a dorm building.   I had friends that let me into the dorms and I was able to get food from the dining hall, etc., so I feel like I still got to see what living in the dorms was like but obviously you are going to be separate from everyone else. As long as you make the effort to make friends you‚Äôll have a great time.
comment,Housing,neutral,Live in the dorm if you can
comment,Housing,positive,I think, honestly, you should do whatever is best for you financially and socially. I‚Äôve definitely had friends that have lived close by or off campus in apartments rather than ever living in the dorms and they have all spoken highly of the experience. On the other hand, I feel like some people do make their first friends in the dorms but that is probably pretty reduced compared to usual as there aren‚Äôt as many opportunities to bond and just chill with your floor w/ covid concerns
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello! I am a prospective student deciding between umich cs under engineering and uiuc stats+cs.   I had a couple questions about the cs environment at umich.  1. I‚Äôve heard it can be difficult to get the classes you want and are often put in waitlists. Will this be an issue when scheduling for cs classes?  2. I know you declare your major your second semester and on. But does this stop me from taking cs classes and starting that path from first semester? I‚Äôm worried about not being prepared enough for internships, etc.  3. I don‚Äôt have much prior experience with cs and was wondering how the introductory classes are.  4. Eventually I hope to do a business minor or double major. I know this is a hectic path and was wondering if this is even an option because Ross can be quite competitive.  Thank you so much!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1.	You may not always get your first choice but you‚Äôll be able to get into the classes you need to graduate.  2.	if you haven‚Äôt taken much cs stuff and don‚Äôt know much about cs, not being declared won‚Äôt really stop you from taking any classes you need to take. Also getting cs internships after freshman year is pretty rare (they usually happen after eecs 281 which is taken your 3rd semester usually).  3.	I had 0 cs experience when I did eecs 183 (first intro class) and thought it was taught really well so you should be good. It was probably one of the best taught and most enjoyable classes I‚Äôve taken so far.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. It depends as class registration is based on number of credits completed (which now does not count AP credits). If you're looking to take the most popular upper levels right after eecs 281, probably won't happen, however for introductory/required cs classes there isn't really a waitlist.  2. Basically what Hwarif said.   3. A lot of people don't have prior experience, and intro classes generally have good foundation and decently strong comradary among students to succeed.   4. Although I'm not doing a business minor/major, I do have a few friends who are and it is not at all uncommon for CS majors to minor in business. Doing a major in it is less common as there is naturally less overlap which means you may end up doing more than 4 years. Ross is competitive but assuming you do 'alright' in classes, applying from the Engin college is not that hard (I've heard).
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,You should go to UIUC.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Honestly the waitlist thing isn‚Äôt a huge issue. You might not be able to get a perfect schedule but you will still be able to take cs classes that you want to. Also they just changed registration so we‚Äôll see how that goes.   You can take CS classes as long as you have the prereqs, but you have to declare to take upper levels. Tbh you can get pretty far in the curriculum without declaring but most people will declare after taking 281.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you're not instate for umich u should go to uiuc. The program there is better and there's more job opportunities for students there

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello, I am an international student from South Korea, and I am quite confused about how to transfer to the computer science major of the University of Michigan Ann Abor. I have graduated from high school 7 years ago and have attended medical school for some years and then went to the military for 2 years. I dropped out of medical school last year, and I am currently enrolled in California community college. I am interested in transferring to UMich, but I have some questions.  1) Is transferring to UMich much easier from community colleges in Michigan than community colleges in other states like California?  2) If I apply to one of the majors in LSA, am I applying to the college itself or the major? I am interested in majoring in computer science, and in this case, should I apply to the computer science major in LSA or LSA itself?  3) If I am accepted to LSA instead of a computer science major, can I declare cs after being accepted to UMich LSA? Is it hard to declare cs in LSA?  4) I have not taken SAT or ACT before. Will I need this to transfer to UMich?   5) Can I transfer to UMich with only 30 credits? I am taking 25 credits this semester, and I think I can manage to get straight A's. But I am worried I might be at a disadvantage because I am from California community college. If I am dead set on attending UMich, should I transfer to community colleges at UMich?  6) Are there any sites with statistics on transfer?  Thank you!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1) some community colleges in Michigan have like partnerships with UMich and that can help. That being said I wouldn‚Äôt wildly worry about it since you are where you are. I wouldn‚Äôt move here to go to a Cc  2) someone can correct me here but you apply to LSA and indicate the major you intend to pursue   3) declaring majors once you‚Äôre in a college isn‚Äôt hard. Michigan doesn‚Äôt have the same like limits/gpa requirements/other stuff for admission into the CS degree  4) you need to reach out to admissions about the lack of SAT/ACT score. They‚Äôll be the best place to get that answered  5) yes you can transfer with that amount of credits UC schools are really stringent with their transfer requirements, it‚Äôs not typical of most other schools to have a minimum credits to transfer. I know people who transferred here after 1 year at another school  6) I think they put out admissions stats but not sure if LSA does. I know Ross does but I‚Äôm not sure on LSA
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Regarding your question on statistics, here‚Äôs the UMich common data set for 2020-2021. Page 10 has some statistics on transfers:  https://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2020-2021_umaa.pdf
post,Employment,neutral,^
comment,Employment,positive,I would like to add there is quite a bit of variation if salary depending on where you go and who you work for. If you stay in Michigan and work for the automotive industry, you‚Äôll probably make 80-90k, whereas if you go out west and work for a tech company you can easily start with over 120k.

post,Prospective Student,positive,So I got my decisions for uofm yesterday and I got waitlisted. uofm is really my top 1 school and immediately accepted the waitlist offer. I‚Äôve only applied to 4 schools and only one has accepted me so far (although itms my least college choice), while another already rejected me. My question is, would it be worth it to wait for the decision? and what can I do while I‚Äôm waiting, like can I still accept a college so I‚Äôll have backup in case they really reject me? I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm really new to this and I‚Äôm really overwhelmed by it.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,While I haven‚Äôt experienced this personally, I have had quite a few friends get off the waitlist quite late for uofm and other schools. What I would do is wait until the last couple days(I think end of May? can‚Äôt remember sorry) to accept your offer to the other school that accepted you just so you can for sure attend a college. This will give you some waiting time for uofm and you can just commit to here if you get in beforehand. If you don‚Äôt get off the waitlist before the commit deadline, don‚Äôt worry I know a handful of people who have gotten off waitlists after. If that happens, you can just commit to uofm instead and like basically drop out of the other school. You won‚Äôt be able to get your like commitment fee back or something like that but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs that big of a deal considering you‚Äôd be going to your num1 choice. Hope this helped good luck!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Brogxx's comment is spot on. If you're set on going, wait as long as possible to accept other offers but make sure not to miss the acceptance deadline to your other choice. I know a guy that waited too long for MSU to accept him and ended up not being able to go to college for a semester. If you do get rejected you can always apply as a transfer. I don't have any evidence outside of word of mouth from friends, but I've heard it's a bit less competitive than applying out of high school. It would also give you a chance to avoid some of the terrible math and chem weeder classes. I would recommend taking those classes at a community college if you do get accepted regardless, your future self will thank you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Yes, you should accept the offer for a backup school. And if you do get off waitlist, then you can tell the other school you will be pursuing your studies elsewhere. It is perfectly normal to do this, as so many us universities utilize waitlists.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,So, I was waitlisted by UMich when I was in high school. I did not get in off the waitlist, and my general experience with being waitlisted to things is that it's a whole lot of worrying about the decision of an entity which is not interested in respecting your time. I'd say, wait for your third response, figure out what financial aid you'd be getting from the colleges that accepted you, pick one, and move on with your life. Go to a different college. It'll be fine. You'll make friends, you'll learn shit, you'll have a good time, and you'll still pay way too much money no matter where you end up.  And hey, if the other university isn't a good fit for you, you can always transfer somewhere different- maybe back here. I did, and things turned out just fine.  Fundamentally, it'll be fine. You'll be fine. Worrying about getting in off the waitlist is not a good time, and it really won't get you anywhere. Wait a little longer if you must, but keep your head up.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Look for a scholarship for potential incoming first year students to apply for and apply for it to show your interest!
post,Housing,positive,I'm looking for nice apartments off campus.  Any recommendations?  Also how's the Varsity and the Z-west?
comment,Housing,positive,join some facebook groups and definitely hit up sites like apartments.com. At this point in the year, if you are searching for housing it will be a little scarce, at least if you want cheap housing. And People always tend to be looking to sublet for a semester if that's what you want, you find those opportunities up the wazoo in facebook groups

post,Prospective Student,positive,Is the admit rate around 4% or is it reasonable like 20%? Are there any guaranteed transfer pathways?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It depends, are you going into College of Engineering CS, or College of LSA CS? Objectively speaking, LSA is easier to transfer into than CoE.   Both programs are virtually identical. The only difference is CoE is 8 more credits, and CoE is an engineering bachelor's degree while the LSA one is a bachelor's in science.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Fair warning, I transferred out of the College of Engineering to LSA and am currently majoring in CS and I didnt know at first but you will pay engineering tuition even if you do the major through LSA which is more expensive. The major is also a little different from what I've heard between the two colleges but ultimately they are basically the same
comment,Prospective Student,positive,This is completely possible. In fact, I did this! I transferred to engineering wanting to do CS from a community college. It was fairly simple honestly. I ended up going to LSA for other things I wanted to do, but the fact remains that I did the transfer program.   Like others have said, once you transfer in you pick what you want to do. Personally I recommend that you transfer into LSA. That is much easier and the degrees are virtually the same. Friends of mine did the degree in both colleges and all of them have gotten very good jobs out of school. There's nothing wrong doing it through LSA.   Basically when you get into CS it's a very crowded major. It makes sense that it's going to be competitive and you have to kind of adjust and push through it. There's a few classes that you have to get a C or above in to qualify for declaring the major. I think they're EECS 280, 281, 203, maybe 183?, and maybe 376?   But in any case, you can do it. I did it and I never thought I could. What's helpful is looking at the major requirements through LSA on the [website.](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-lsa/)   There's a link on there to a PDF kind of outlining what you need to take. Remember to sign up for classes right when you are able to and to keep pushing to get into the classes you need! Always DM me if you have more questions.
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Hey guys, I‚Äôm a high school senior and I‚Äôve been waitlisted by UMich. Currently I have applied to LSA; however, I intend to pursue business at Ross if I get in from the waitlist.  From what I have read, it is possible to transfer into Ross after the first year at LSA. However, it is not an easy process and spots are limited. Could some of you please shed some light on this and share what the current situation for internal transfers (LSA to Ross) is like.  I intend to pursue Finance and I have a few other options as of now. However, UMich would be my first choice and I would heavily consider picking it if there are chances of getting into Ross from LSA as a transfer during sophomore year.  Is it true that only 125 spots are reserved for LSA to Ross transfers? Besides, what would the average applicant‚Äôs GPA/profile be like?  As of now I‚Äôm on the waitlist for Notre Dame (Mendoza), UCLA and UNC as well. However, I‚Äôm really inclined towards picking UMich as long as my chances of making it into Ross are decent.  Sorry if this question is repeated and if it comes off as annoying. I did check the subreddit for past questions like this - however, most posts were rather outdated and I really wanted to obtain a fresh perspective on this.  Edit: I‚Äôm an international student if it matters.

post,Housing,positive,I got into both UMich Honors College and Residential college. From my understanding, I can be in both as long as I live in RC dorms. If the Honors College dorms are a  lot better, however, I'm willing to drop RC and just do honors college. Does anyone know if there is a big difference between the Honors and RC dorms?
comment,Housing,positive,There is no Honors College at Michigan. You are enrolled in the College of LSA. It‚Äôs just a program within LSA.   I‚Äôm pretty sure East Quad has AC in the dorm rooms and South Quad does not (it‚Äôs only in common areas). Otherwise, they‚Äôre both on central campus. They‚Äôve both been renovated recently. They both have large dining halls. Both well above average freshman dorms.
comment,Housing,positive,Residential puts you in East Quad, which is personally my favorite freshmen-accessible dorm on campus. Great location, very groovy building with lots of study spots, and dining hall is subjectively equal to SQ‚Äôs quality-wise, both above average for UMich
comment,Housing,positive,I recommend staying in the Residential College. East Quad is a beautiful and new building, and you get to form a community with the other RC students right when you get to campus, which can help with the adjustment period.

As of 2013, the registrar said that they did not take transfer credits from online classes...yet, this was before a pandemic in 2013.  Did anyone take any online summer classes that transferred last year? Or do I have to cough up the premium to take online classes at UofM specifically?  I have no idea which office to contact to ask this question/scenario Al advice is highly appreciated!!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,they‚Äôre taking online courses through the end of the 2020-2021 school year, or through the spring/summer semester

post,Prospective Student,positive,Anybody else waiting for the second round of LSA honors decisions to come out? Thoughts from current students about the honors program?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It really depends on what you‚Äôre looking for! I met a lot of great friends through housing but I frankly found the honors classes to be kind of useless to me. A lot of the opportunities you get from honors can be found elsewhere, but honors makes things like advising and community a lot more accessible imo. I definitely thought that my experience has been worth it so far, but there are cons to consider when you make your decision. I hope this was helpful!

I feel like sometimes when it comes to men's basketball all people wanna talk about is the glory years of the late 90s and early 2000s. Most current undergrads weren't even born yet, let alone following the team.   I was the perfect age for following and getting excited about those teams. If you can believe it we won a bunch of SEC west division titles and made the NCAA tourney 5/6 years from 97 to 02.   For me though nothing beats the magic of that 2001 team. Squeaked by Iona in the first round and then pulled off the 59-56 win against Notre Dame to make it to the Sweet Sixteen (still the only one in program history). Rahim Lockhart was unstoppable that night with 24 points and Jason Harrison sunk the game winning shot with under a minute to go. Here's to hoping we get back there soon, I think Kermit has us headed in the right direction!

post,Degree,positive,I'm a CS major right now, but to be honest, I hate computer science. I'm good at it, and I'll be in lots of debt by graduation, so I stuck with it for a while (up to 281), hoping for high paying jobs. I regret it, I want to do something I care about - I just don't want to be caught working at McDonald's with a degree.  For any EEB majors, current or graduated (or other environmental science majors) - what are job prospects out of these majors at UMich? I'd love to work in conservation, some sort of field ecology, or environmental education. I'd also be open to pursuing academia, if I could afford it. Worth noting, I'll also have a CS minor when I graduate. Will getting a job be a struggle without the privilege of having time to volunteer during college or after? And, if I can't find an internship during my degree, will I be screwed after? Are there post graduation internships, or entry level jobs for those without an internship? If I do change to an EEB major, what can I do to assure I get a decent job out of college?
comment,Degree,positive,If you are interested in pursuing grad school, a surprising amount of EEB research is very computational, which your CS experience would definitely be a plus for when applying.
post,New Student,positive,Hello. I've been accepted for the movement science (kinesiology) master's programme at U-M, which will commence this coming fall! I'm feeling absolutely ecstatic, especially since this will be my first time studying in the US. But that also means I'm not very aware of the university life/culture here...  So, I had a few questions in mind that I hoped can be answered here:  1. Orientation - Will there be some kind of "orientation" week for the postgraduate students? Because we have "fresher's week" for first years in the UK, but they weren't really intended for the master's/doctorate students. Is it the same here? If the latter, are you supposed to just figure things out on your own? 2. Commencement preparation - Slightly relating to Q. 1, I think I've seen somewhere that the official start date for U-M this year's fall will be 31 Aug: how much earlier do grad students typically return back to U-M? Is there anything going on that I should be aware of/preparing for before this date? 3. Undergraduate vs postgraduate workload - What are your opinions on the workload shift from bachelor's to master's (specifically MVS MS)? For comparison, I had 6 modules in my final year of BSc, which consisted of a practical project, library project, a couple of in-course assessments (PPT/poster presentations etc.) 4 final exams and \~250 hrs total of lectures/tutorials/workshops in total. 4. Social life as a grad student - I'm not really a hard party-goer, but I do like having a casual pint at pubs or going out to bars/nightclubs\* from time to time. What's the social life like for grad students (in normal cases as well, since the lockdowns seem to be easing)? Do grad students join in with undergrads when socialising/partying etc.? Because I always hung out with grads when I was an undergrad. Also, does U-M have a union/university bar that all students go to? By the looks of it on this subreddit, everyone seems to go to independent pubs/bars in Ann Arbor. 5. Sports societies/clubs - I was an avid fencer, but I'm interested in trying out other sports like climbing, triathlon and shooting. Can grads join these clubs as well, or is it typically just for undergrads? Also, are beginners allowed to join (I'm not really interested in joining/trying out for teams, just for social/recreational purposes\*)? 6. Weather - What are the weather conditions like in Ann Arbor during the fall/winter? In the UK, it's typically quite warm in early Sept with 68F highs/52F lows, then it goes down to 48F highs/38F lows in Dec/Jan/Feb, and starts to rise back up in Mar. 7. Textbooks - Are textbooks necessary (especially for MVS MS) at grad level? I bought 3 textbooks for my bachelor's and I think I've only opened them once in my life. Do you really need them at higher levels? I assume most students just go online/papers/Google Scholar etc. for more information?  Thank you very much in advance!  Edit 1: \*  Edit 2: Please feel free to add anything relevant to this post. Anything will help!
comment,New Student,positive,Congrats!  The School of Kinesiology puts on an orientation day for new graduate students every fall. This typically takes place a few days before school officially starts.  Most graduate students live in Ann Arbor year-round. This because graduate students typically still work during the summer.  I'm not familiar with modules. Your course load will depend on how long you plan on taking to complete your degree. If you're planning for just 1 year, you'll be taking 15 credits each semester which was doable in my experience. They say each credit hour equates to approximately 2-3 hours outside of class each week, though this will vary from week to week.  In my experience, undergrad was harder than graduate school.  I'm not a party-goer either. Before covid, I socialized with friends who like to play board games and weekend/intramural sports. There are bars close by to campus but I really can't speak to the scene at each one.  Yes, graduate students can join club sports. Club sports are typically very competitive so it might be difficult to make the team. Intramural sports are really fun, more laidback (can still be competitive), and a smaller time commitment. No tryout is required. You just sign-up and pay a small fee.  The beginning of fall is really pleasant but by Halloween, it's usually decently cold and just gets worse until about the beginning of March. We get a decent amount of snow in January and February.  Depends on the class you are taking but most likely no.  &#x200B;  Happy to answer any more questions you may have.
comment,New Student,positive,I'm from the UK and I started my PhD here in the autumn of 2019.  I had an orientation but it will likely be covid permitting during this time. It's still largely figure it out on your own, but if it was like when I first attended, your department might do a brief orientation + the larger scale college in which your department fits into.  I came a few weeks prior to the start of the school year to orientate myself in a new country as well as obtain relevant ID, etc.  Probably depends on yourself who you end up socializing with. I'd say the grad student social culture ultimately depends on you; central campus is easily accessible so it's easy to meet for a drink. Unfortunately having a university pub is not really a thing here; need to remember that the legal drinking age in the US is 21 lol. Nevertheless, Ann Arbor has a lot of bars to visit. Just remember that visiting bars is probably more of a grad student activity and it may be a bit less common for grad students to hang out with undergrads compared to in the UK when it comes to drinking.  Unfortunately the sports clubs here aren't structured to be inclusive for all levels like at most UK universities. There are quite a few sports clubs that require trials in order to play and there isn't anything set up for people who want to play for fun. Although, this isn't the case for all sports and its likely the more 'obscure' it is, the more accessible it is to everyone. There is an orientation event for clubs and societies near the start or middle of sepetember. Grad students are allowed to join though. As an additional note, someone mentioned IM sports, there are opportunities there for more varied skill-levels in sports.   Winter sucks. The rest of the seasons, mainly autumn and summer, are really enjoyable.
comment,New Student,positive,I was admitted as a Grad student in Engineering in Winter 20.  It‚Äôs been a tough start not gonna lie. Granted I was living in Ann Arbor for 5 months prior and have a few friends (broke up with my ex in the process). And side note, I was admitted as an NCFD initially, now fully accepted.   But:  1. No orientation 2. No info ok that from me 3. Depends on how many classes you take. I work full time too so I took 1 class, and my first was super manageable and got an A- , the next is killing me with the workload, so it all depends on the program and specific class  4. It‚Äôs been easy to go out to see friends I already made, be it at their houses or mine, or at bars. No parties unless you‚Äôre gonna have frat friends. But I have not been able to join clubs or go out to meet people on my own. People in my class are barely options either since all classes right now are online and most (i‚Äôd say 90%) of people DO NOT live in A2. Not having in person classes is a struggle to meet people. Hoping the Fall will be better for that.  5. You could always try to contact the clubs gia maizepage or their social media, but no guarantees of an answer. I‚Äôve had trouble with that.  6. Be prepared for a cold winter. We get drops below 0C all the time. November to February are the ones you wanna look out for. Snow snow snow. I‚Äôve been in Michigan 2 winters, my first was super mild, this past one was much worse ( granted i like the snow) so if you can handle it great! Otherwise the summer spring is an awesome time! Never too hot so everyone is always outside!  7. No textbooks for me, but then again depends on the class as well.    Please do not let this discourage you from coming here! UofM was always my dream school but my timing sucks with Covid. My best friends keeps telling me that it will get better once thing start returning to normal so always keeping my head up!  Good luck and don‚Äôt hesitate reaching out if you need someone to have a pint with!

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi everyone,  I was admitted to the College of Engineering and I plan on attending UMich this upcoming school year. I haven't been to Ann Arbor so my parents and I were planning on visiting sometime before May.   To my understanding, there are no in-person campus tours, so when I visit I will probably be walking around campus figuring things out using a map or my phone.   Are the campus buildings available to walk into? Like, can I just walk into the engineering buildings to see what's going on inside or is that strictly prohibited?  Sorry if that's a stupid question. I'm not really caught up with the campus rules and I'm not even sure if most of you guys are virtual or what's going on. I also don't want to drive up 10 hours and back just to observe buildings from outside.   Also, any tips for while I'm up there would be highly appreciated. Thank you!!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,To get into a building you need to be a student or employee, swipe your MCard for entry, and show an app that verifies you got covid tested here and filled out your daily check-in survey, so you won‚Äôt really be able to just pop in and out of buildings.  Also most people are strictly-virtual right now, only a few rare classes have in-person meetings, mostly just things where they can‚Äôt really do remote
comment,Prospective Student,negative,No one checks your MCard or anything so if you happen to walk in behind someone no one will stop you
post,Prospective Student,positive, I'm an admitted student to UMich, but I'm still waiting on my Ross decision. I'm currently choosing between Indiana and Michigan so I wanted to know if the lack of specialization in the business school becomes a problem. Is the general business education there pretty solid regardless?  Also, how's the social scene? Not necessarily parties, but just chill vibes of the school. Easy to make friends? Do people look depressing? Any answers will help. Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Incoming Ross student here. While I'm not certain as to exactly how it works, I'm fairly certain that you do specialize in a certain area at some point here.
post,Academics - Other Topics,negative,I'm sure it depends on the professor, but do professors in general cut you any slack if your pet dies?   I just found out that I'm going to have to put my cat down on the same day that I have an exam (tomorrow), and I can hardly stop crying much less actually study. My focus is totally shot. I don't know what to do, but I'm guessing it's going to end up being one of those things you just power through.   Does anyone have experience with this?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Most professors that I've had do have a heart for that sort of thing but don't expect too much time for an extension, just usually a couple days.   Btw, I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your pet
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Last semester I had one professor push back my final by a day and another professor push back a lab by two days. For both I only asked for a one day extension. Really grateful for that, always sad to hear about horror stories when this happens. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,First of all, I am incredibly sorry for your loss. I had to put my cat down during the school year and it was incredibly difficult to focus or do anything for quite a while. Thus, I had a similar experience, albeit it wasn‚Äôt at exam time. I simply emailed them and told them I had a family emergency and couldn‚Äôt make it in, and asked  for an extension on my assignments. They‚Äôll probably ask for documentation, but ought to cut you some slack. It‚Äôs best to reach out and be honest. If they‚Äôre not accommodating, shame on them, and reach out to the appropriate office to complain and take the time you need. No assignment is worth your mental health in this situation.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Final exams are hard to move so while they will be sympathetic they may not have much power to do anything. If it is a final report/project and stuff like that they will have more ability to help.  Tell them what you are asking for and why that amount (in terms of extension) as opposed to expecting them to try and figure out what you need. for example. I won't be able to focus on the day and so if the deadline could be push backed two days so I have a day before the exam to try and get back into the mindset of school.
post,Prospective Student,negative,I thought that March 31st was the deadline for incoming student financial aid submissions but I haven't heard anything back from the BSI program yet... I thought that they would release admission decisions before the deadline, was I wrong?

post,Research,positive,My team and I are doing a data collection drive for our project involving Theory of Mind using Minecraft as a setting.  To participate please [sign up using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo3bBC86ROtbK1zlP3YdyCRV6O4eVPjy2gCyxdJOFbj-b8AA/viewform?usp=sf_link) using your [umich.edu](https://umich.edu) emails and let us know when you are available. The session will last about one hour. We will be pairing you based on your availability and we will be sending you a calendar invite for your game.  Minimal experience with Minecraft is appreciated, i.e. using tools and moving materials around, though novices catch on quickly since you will be playing a constrained version of the game but may take a bit more than an hour.  Amazon gift cards worth 10$ will be provided as compensation.  Thank you! I hope you'll have fun!
post,Prospective Student,positive,senior in HS who got in recently  Are the gyms and fitness centers (basketball, track, field) at UMich free for all students? Also what are the best amenities to take advantage of? since umich charges a crazy amount in tuition
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You pay for them in your tuition so yes they‚Äôre free as long as you‚Äôre currently taking classes. The IM (towards south campus) and the NCRB (on north campus) are really nice and have been recently renovated. The CCRB (on central) is actually the exact same gym that Jesus Christ used 2000 years ago. There‚Äôs no AC, and it‚Äôs pretty run down. There‚Äôs plans to renovate it soon but I‚Äôm not sure on the exact dates.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The facilities are 'free' in the same way breakfast at Hampton Inn is free. There is a $65 unions and recreation fee per term that is baked into the tuition cost.   It's been 10 years since I used them so I'll let others chime in on how things are now. Two of the three have been renovated in recent years.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey! I got accepted to Georgia Tech and the University of Michigan as an international Industrial Engineering Student! I would probably like to minor/have a certificate in business, so business school and cost are important factors to me. I would probably like to work in IB, consulting, or tech companies. I would like to have the POV of Michigan students to help guide my decision.   * At GT, IE is ranked 1st and its business school is ranked 19th in the country. It would cost around 50k a year. * Michigan is 2nd in Industrial Engineering and 3rd in Business. It costs around 70k a year.  So, to recap, they are both similar in IE, but Michigan is better in Business and probably has better investment banking or consulting placement. But is it worth 80k more over 4 years? My family could technically pay for both, but I don't want to pay more than strictly necessary, especially as I plan to pursue an MBA in the future.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Both are great schools so I think this decision really comes down to the environment that you‚Äôll thrive best in! Personally I would recommend choosing the cheaper school, but if you can afford them both then I think you should just go with which one you like more. Your success comes so much more from what you make of the college experience and how well you thrive in a certain setting than the ranking of the school. Umich is definitely a large big 10 school that gives you the work hard play hard ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. It‚Äôs such a big school though, that no matter your personality/interests you can find a crowd where you belong!  It‚Äôs also probably beneficial to note that you‚Äôll have to apply to Ross during your sophomore year to get a business minor, and the applications can be pretty selective. Do some research on that if you haven‚Äôt already. Good luck making your decision!
post,Social,positive,** I deleted my other posting due to backlash and other unnecessary issues that came from me trying to make a joke. So I decided to make one specifically for for the answers I was looking for.**  *I‚Äôve also scrolled through the threads with many social life answers, but I‚Äôm looking for more answers tailored with personal experiences to get a feel for the school social atmosphere.**  Topic: Social Life at UMich  Questions:  ** POC RELATED ** (Others are free to answer if you have seen/can answer)  - How has UMich social experience been for you during COVID-19? - Does this school have any racist occurrences? - Do you feel excluded from UMich‚Äôs student body? - POC tailored groups friendly?  Other Questions/Commentary: - Personal experiences of making new friends (or losing) - UMich‚Äôs actions towards making the students feel socially involved during the pandemic - Dating/Romance at UMich - Roommate Tips/Socializing   (You are free to put other questions/ commentary pertaining to UMich social life in the chat because I want this thread to be as informational as it can be.)
comment,Social,neutral,I haven't experienced any racism since coming to UMich, and feel pretty well included. I'm not a part of any POC tailored groups, so I can't give you any input there, but being a POC at Michigan isn't different from being anyone else, at least in my experience.
post,Housing,negative,This is a throwaway account. Does anyone know anything about the landlord Marvin Carlson, I‚Äôve heard some bad reviews.
comment,Housing,positive,He was my landlord last year, feel free to pm me with any questions.
post,Housing,positive,I'm looking for an apartment close to campus to share with my sister that doesn't charge per person since only I will be paying rent (which seems to be hard to find with student apartments).  So basically a place that rents per unit and allows 2 occupants/a one bedroom that allows 2 occupants, but doesn't charge per person.  That was kinda hard to explain, hope it makes sense.
comment,Housing,positive,Maybe look for a place that allows couples/families? I know one friend who lives in a one bedroom apartment with their gf but the rent is basically like paying for 2 people (I think it‚Äôs around 1800 but their place is pretty big)   Another tip is that you might have better luck renting from local landlords who are more flexible than high rise student accommodation companies.   (This is probably illegal/breaks the lease agreement but literally what is stopping her from just living with you without telling anyone, not sure how they‚Äôd find out. My SO and I/my flatmate‚Äôs SO and them live at each other‚Äôs places 50% of the time and no one notices.)
comment,Housing,positive,Willowtree leases 1-2 bedroom apartments with rent per unit, and they allow 1-2 people per bedroom. Depending on the specific type, I think they‚Äôre around $1000-$1130 per month. However, it‚Äôs by north campus, but you didn‚Äôt specify, so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for.
comment,Housing,neutral,That's weird, your sister was looking to share an apartment with me.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I know this is a very vague question but being a pre med comes with a lot of anxiety. I have seen the statistics that say only like 10-20% of people who come in as pre med make it through to medical school. I just wanted to hear the perspective of people who made it through and ended up applying and perhaps are even successful. Advice that led you to succeed or on you way towards it would be greatly appreciated and once again sorry for the vague question.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hi, I am Graduating this year and was accepted to med school for the coming fall. This is gonna be a jumbled list, but from my experience, here is what I'll say:  1. Make yourself a plan for the next day/week, as you're going to bed. It gives you a purpose to sleep and wake up in a normal fashion. 2. Delay of gratification/Grit - Just know that it's gonna be a challenge. I had moments studying for exams, that I was on verge of a panic attack, or just too hyped on caffeine, maybe a mix of both. However, you gotta just get through it. Sometimes, studying for an exam means not seeing another person for 3 days. You might have 3 Exams over the course of two days. You just gotta grind it out. 3. Take care of yourself! Sleeping, Eating (Healthy), Exercising. Can't stress this enough. Especially in the winter, get yourself doing something in a gym or outside. 4. Office hours - Nothing makes me more upset than someone who says a class is confusing but doesn't seek help from the prof or GSIs. If you are confused. Go to Office hours. They literally write the exams and assignments. Also, a great way to get letters of rec and learn about research opportunities. 5. Study groups - either through talking to people in the class or through SLC. Great way to meet people and study. A great way to study is to try explaining/teaching it to someone else. Helped a lot with Orgo. 6. Grades aren't the whole story. Extracurriculars like clubs, volunteering, etc... are important as well. Med school admissions want to see a well-rounded candidate 7. Good luck!
post,Prospective Student,positive,I want to go to Michigan, but finances are kind of holding me back. I at least want to go there for a year just to dip my feet in the water, and if it turns out I can pay for it, I would stay for the rest of my four years. If it absolutely wrecks me, then I would transfer to another college. At that point though, would it even be worth it?? I'm an out of state prospective nursing student btw.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,What are your other options? If there‚Äôs a similar school (education and social wise?) that‚Äôs cheaper (in state?) it might just be better to go there.   Honestly, I love Michigan, but I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ~all it seems to be~, but I think that‚Äôs true for a lot of colleges. I know it‚Äôs a dream school for many but if you end up at a similar school it‚Äôll pretty much be the same experience. College is college.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm an in-state nursing student here, and while a lot of my classmates are from out of state, I would tell you to seriously think hard before choosing an out of state school. I personally can‚Äôt justify getting a nursing degree paying out of state tuition (and acquiring the loans necessary). Everyone‚Äôs situation is different, and you will figure out what works for you, but nursing is one of the few careers where the school you go to does not matter when it comes to applying for jobs and grad school.   The nursing program here is really great, and the social community of umich is awesome, but paying $60k+ per year for the same classes you would take at an in-state school for half the cost is a tough sell.   I know your question focused more on only going here for a year, but here are some things you should consider before committing anywhere: - building a friend group in a new community can be very challenging, would you be able to uproot yourself and leave all the friends you have made after your freshman year due to finances?  - what if you can‚Äôt make yourself leave after your first year due to the above factors? How will you pay for it? - nursing schools can be very hard to apply/transfer into (as you well know). Would you need to apply as a transfer student at a different school back home after your first year? I think this would add a lot of stress, and you‚Äôll need to make sure your classes can transfer. The program here is very structured and lock-step, so switching schools and taking breaks can be more complicated than with other majors. - will you be taking a large amount of loans and/or depleting your college savings to come here for one year? If so it might be wiser in the long run to choose a different school and allow your money to get you further!  - what is it that makes you want to come to umich so badly? Are you able to get those things  (social aspect, specific academic programs, etc) at a school more in your price range?   Make sure to look at salaries for your goal post-grad nursing job and compare them to the amount of loans you‚Äôd need to take to come here. For me, it would be nearly impossible to come in knowing you‚Äôll have to transfer in a year, but it might be different for you. I wish you luck with your decision and congrats on getting into u of m!! :)  EDIT: feel free to message me if you have any other questions
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Michigan takes a lot of transfer applicant, particularly in state.   Michagan was 5 of my friends' dream school. None of them got in. 4 of them ended up going to UMass Amherst, their in state safety school, and absolutely fell in love with it. If you can't afford Michigan (or can only afford a couple years), maybe consider going to a cheaper school, and if you still want to come to Michigan after a year or two you can apply as a transfer student.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,What if you totally fall in love with umich then can‚Äôt pay for it?
post,Prospective Student,neutral,
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Compared to NC State? Michigan is worth the extra money. There is nothing special about NC State, while UMich is a top University, especially for computer science. Employers are going to give you more opportunities if you go to a top end school like Michigan.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I've been seeing a lot of these posts on this subreddit since college results seem to be coming out. My stance is that if the colleges are close in academics, take the cheaper one. If one is significantly better, but there's no way you can afford it, obviously, take the cheaper one. However, I also feel there's this trend of saying "all colleges are the same". I mean agreed that many colleges are similar in education, but if every college is "the same", why should anyone go to a "top" school? You can probably deduce my recommendation from this based on your family income.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Yea Michigan 100%
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Lurking grad student here. My partner is from Raleigh and both of his siblings went to NC State but he chose to go out of state to Virginia Tech for electrical engineering.   Does he regret the debt? Yeah some days. Was VT better than NC State? Definitely.  One thing i would look at is NC STate and Michigans CS career fairs and what companies are present. For context, both my partner and I moved to MI to be engineers in the auto industry so that's our perspective so this example might not be the most applicable. Anyways, Ford, for example, only recruits out of certain schools, VT and U of M are two of those schools. It's way harder, but not impossible, to get a job at Ford if you're not at one of the target recruitment schools. Two alternative paths for recruitment are things like SAE car competitions and SWE conferences. This will be true for a lot of big name companies.  Long story short, being a good student at nc state will take you far but you might have to hustle more for opportunities that might come easier at michigan. Take advantage of clubs and societies on campus that will help you land a job.  also sunshine. we don't have a lot of the 6 months out of the year. just sayin.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Had this been any other public university in the country -- with the possible exception of the University of California flagship campuses -- NC State would have been a better bang for the buck (I lived in Raleigh, NC before, and I have to say, it is really a brilliant place to be!). However, especially concerning the major of Computer Science, Michigan simply has too good of a program to forgo. Unless your family is in a really tight situation right now, I wouldn't worry too much about the cost, since a Michigan CS degree will probably land you a job paying $100k+ a year anyways.

post,COVID-19,positive,I‚Äôm a transfer and my old school has already distributed funds from the 3rd stimulus to students, basically like they did with the CARES act. All universities have to give a certain amount of the $ directly to students in grants. I can‚Äôt seem to find any info about how U of M is doing this. Has anyone heard/seen anything?
comment,COVID-19,negative,Haven‚Äôt seen anything but it might be through the Emergency Student Funding that was going around in the daily emails a few weeks back?
post,Finances,neutral,I‚Äôm most curious about the alumni who were in debt for a long time. Not the people who pay it off in a year or two.
comment,Finances,positive,I graduated with around $70K in debt and a starting salary of $70K with pretty minimal bonuses. Six years out of school, I make around $95K with another 15% in bonuses. I‚Äôve paid more than the minimums on my loans consistently (other than leaving my federal loans untouched while the government has frozen interest at 0% because of COVID, in case they end up forgiving some federal loans) and now have a balance of around $35K. I live comfortably in a major city and I save well for my retirement, but I can‚Äôt really save for a down payment for a house or condo (it doesn‚Äôt help that housing is expensive here and people often put 20% down).   Whether or not it was ‚Äúworth it‚Äù depends on what your next best option is and how much that costs. Mine was MTU where I had a full tuition scholarship. Looking back, it probably would have been a better financial decision to go there. I would have still been very employable as an engineer. (From a personal standpoint, the calculus is different. I ended up majoring in IOE, which Tech doesn‚Äôt offer. And I met my spouse and good friends at Michigan. Obviously I don‚Äôt want to give that up. But it‚Äôs plenty likely that I would have made friends and found a field I liked  at another school. And I would probably own a home by now, and not be stressing about paying for my wedding.)
comment,Finances,positive,Dont take debt more than a year of salary at your first job.  Exceptions to this is law and med school. If you do you're screwing yourself over in the future if you want a house or car. Contrary to popular belief you can have a great life even without going to a top school.
comment,Finances,positive,I had $150k in debt, as an out-of-state student with no help from parents.    Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt trade my time at UM for anything. It is such a unique, important, and special place to me. The debt was completely paid off within 7 years of graduating, but the payoff of going to UM will stay with me the rest of my life.    Like others have said though, probably don‚Äôt go $150k into debt with a major in art
comment,Finances,positive,Assuming you're talking about undergrad, as grad school is highly dependent on individual program:  While I went to Umich and was lucky enough to not have debt, many of my friends did. I think it depends on a couple factors: (1) how much debt are you talking about (in state vs out of state), and (2) what field are you entering?  For (2), there are a couple degrees where undergrad prestige matters. My engineering friends are all working for really impressive companies who only recruit at certain schools (think Spacex, Google, etc.), and/or had no issues getting into other impressive engineering grad schools. Even the ones who had a good amount of debt found it worth the extra cost over a more local school. Meanwhile, the "Michigan" degree was absolutely not worth the extra $$ for my friends who didn't really know what they wanted to do and just picked a major that either wasn't tied to a career or required grad school that doesn't care about your undergrad prestige. For (1), FWIW, despite me and my husband both going to and loving UM, I'm going to discourage my children from applying there for undergrad because we are not in-state and, unless they got some great scholarships, I just don't see it being worth the money when our state has a couple top notch public universities for a fraction of the cost.
comment,Finances,positive,I was in-state but worked to pay for college myself.  This can be tackled several ways... - Experience: Did you enjoy it? Was that worth it? - Education: Does UM offer something unique in this regard? Can you get something similar in-state for cheaper? - Prestige: Will graduating from UM‚Äôs School of ____ help me in the future?  With ‚Äújust‚Äù a BS from UM, the education/prestige wouldn‚Äôt have been worth the extra $ for me, in my field of work. It would have totally been worth it from the experience perspective (met my wife there!), but I didn‚Äôt know this going in.
comment,Finances,positive,I transferred here junior year and graduated with 20k of student debt. I graduated in 2016 and am still paying it off. Purely for the academics? I‚Äôm not so sure about. But the memories I had there were incredible, and I would gladly do it again. I met the person im going to spend my life with, and made lifelong friends.
comment,Finances,negative,Graduating with zero debt. Still not worth it. This place sucks.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi all! I‚Äôm an international student admitted into the Urban Tech programme at Taubman (starting Winter 2022) I was wondering if it‚Äôs possible to transfer to the Archi programme even before school officially starts.   Thanks in advance!!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Your best bet is to contact admissions or Bryan Boyer whose the programs director brboyer@umich.edu
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You can‚Äôt really transfer into the arch program as a freshman because the program doesn‚Äôt officially start until your junior year after taking all the pre-arch requirements. Taubman‚Äôs undergrad program is undergoing a lot of curricular changes, but as far as I know the pre-arch courses are switching from semester long studios to half-semester ‚Äúmodules.‚Äù You would be required to take at least 6 of 9 of these modules as well as the other gen ed requirements to transfer into the arch program your junior year. The pre-arch courses also give you a chance to see if architecture is something you actually would want to major in without committing to it initially. I‚Äôm not sure how the Urban Tech curriculum/scheduling works since that‚Äôs super new but I would talk to admissions and academic advising to see how you can start taking pre-arch classes & fulfilling requirements to transfer
post,Student Organization,negative,Hey guys, I was just wondering if anyone has gotten an email with a decision on whether they were accepted as a peer mentor into the Michigan Mentorship Program (also called University Mentorship Program)?? I applied a while ago, got interviewed, and I thought I'd at least get an email rejection but haven't heard back since.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Hey, I was in the Michigan Mentorship Program about a year ago, but back then people would sign up for it like you would any other Psychology course and it didn't require an interview. I guess interviews are a somewhat new change Dr. Quart made to the program?  Feel free to ask me any questions about the program by the way.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Same LMFAO we really out here waiting to see
post,Prospective Student,positive,I've been admitted to "Engineering: first year" and I have applied for Computer science and engineering. I have heard that in some schools in the US (like UW seattle), it's extremely competitive to get a CS major after first year. Is that true in UMich too? Will I be able to get my major, how competitive will it be? It's quite expensive and I'm not willing to go if I can't get my major for sure.   Also it's almost time to commit so if you can share with me a bit about the weather (heard it's way too cold), internship opportunities, racism (I'm South Asian), and job placements there it would be great! Or anything else I should know as an international before I commit!  Thanks in advance!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,u/ChrisBB212  Virtually none of the majors at Michigan require an application; I believe only PPE and those that require transferring schools (like kinesiology or school of information). CS and engineering are not in that category.  Majors are open to all students within that colleges and you can declare or switch majors freely. It is Michigan‚Äôs philosophy to let students choose to pursue what they want and not have to decide while they‚Äôre still in high school.   To declare a major, you just need to pass a set of prerequisites, generally in freshmen and sophomore year, with at least a C or C-. For computer science, I believe it‚Äôs eecs 183/280/203 and math 115/116. These are challenging classes and some students are weeded out of the major because of that, but the vast majority lads and are able to declare.  Weather: too cold, but manageable. It‚Äôs been quite nice lately, and I would never have been so positive in January.  Internships: pretty good potential, particularly after you‚Äôve completed a couple of years.   Racism: not really a big issue here from my understanding, although sometimes people just suck. I‚Äôm white, though, so maybe there‚Äôs a lot going on that I‚Äôm not aware of.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,There‚Äôs no competition really towards getting into a major. That being said the classes u/Veauros pointed out are challenging. Those classes usually average around a B, so if you‚Äôre able to keep your head down and stay motivated to study, you‚Äôll be just fine. Feel free to take a lighter work load your first semester just to get use to the Michigan way.  So while CSE is not competitive to major in, it is competitive to push classes and get internships. This year, I came in with a lot of ap credit, about 38 credits. These credits allowed me to get through a bunch of the general education credits, so I am now signing up for the smaller Upper Level CS courses. Unfortunately, umich does not account for ap credits in your registration date, so I got a registration date that is very late in the registration period making it unlikely that I‚Äôll have high priority in getting the classes I desire. Feel free to message me if that idea doesn‚Äôt make sense, but essentially, if you‚Äôre getting a lot of credits from ap/ib exams, expect to have a little difficulty with picking classes. Moving on to internships, internships for cs are challenging everywhere. It‚Äôs not uncommon to apply to hundreds of places before getting a response let alone an offer. That being said, both of Michigan‚Äôs fall and winter career fairs are fantastic. I highly suggest going to the smaller companies where you can meet with the recruiters and actually have a conversation with them. Even though I‚Äôm a freshman, I was able to get a fairly interesting internship this way.  I‚Äôm South Asian as well, and I have felt very welcomed at Michigan, nothing really to say in that regard.  Feel free to message if any of this doesn‚Äôt make sense!
comment,Prospective Student,negative,U don't need to apply to a major. I'm not really sure of any major college campus with race issues but I could be wrong, haven't really seen anything bad in my 2 years here.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm also a prospective (more like ‚Äúincoming‚Äù) student admitted to CoE so I don‚Äôt know a lot of details, but I think UMich is pretty lax about letting students choose the major they want, so I don‚Äôt imagine there would be any trouble. Maybe I‚Äôve been wrong this entire time, though? Haha, I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôd love to see what wisdom others can share :)

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey, I‚Äôm a recent transfer admit to Umich. I am currently a freshman business and econ major at CWRU and want to study BBA at Ross. I was admitted to LSA but was wondering how I can apply to Ross?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You wouldn‚Äôt be able to apply for cross campus transfer to Ross until you completed a year in LSA. And then Ross is a rigid three year program. So you‚Äôd end up spending five years in college, and there‚Äôs a good chance you wouldn‚Äôt be accepted to Ross - it‚Äôs really competitive to transfer in, they don‚Äôt have many spots for cross campus transfers.

After the orientation, you need to do 10 hours of Paw 1 volunteering, including laundry, administrative tasks, cleaning, etc. After 10 hours, you can choose to become a Paw 2 Cat Comforter or Paw 2 Dog Walker.

post,Finances,positive,I received one but haven't accepted it yet. I know some schools will reduce grant aid if you receive scholarships, does umich do that?
comment,Finances,positive,Oh yes they do.
comment,Finances,neutral,Try to have them write the scholarship to you without sending it to the university. You get to keep the money and your aid doesn't get reduced.
post,Finances,neutral,Hey all!  I was wondering if anyone knows how financial aid works for 0 EFC student applying for a Spring and Summer semester. I have an understanding that we only get 10 semesters of financial aid, and so I was wondering if anyone knew if a Spring semester would be considered .5 of a semester or if it is counted as one entire semester?
comment,Finances,positive,each of spring and summer is .5 of a semester of aid, so taking only spring in .5 but taking both is like 1 semester of aid.
post,Finances,neutral,I know financial aid packages change after each year... But do they tend to change for the better or for the worse? Or does it depend?  Also, a follow up question. Is anyone in a work-based program (idk if that is what it is called) where you work for money that'll go towards paying for tuition? If so, is it worth it?
comment,Finances,neutral,For me, my financial aid package has been roughly the same for the past two years. I think it just depends on whether or not your family income changed in the past year.
comment,Finances,negative,Depends on situation. My finaid was consistent but that's because my efc was 0 (no parents).  As for work study its usually a net negative. Finaid is need based so if you make more money your efc goes up so they take away aid
comment,Finances,negative,It depends on a lot of things, unfortunately for me, it's only been for the worse.
comment,Finances,positive,Yeah, my financial aid package changed for the worse every year. The university doesn't really increase your aid after they increase tuition every year or when they start charging you upper level tuition. I got like $8,000 for housing/other expenses my freshman year and then every year afterward, that number decreased by like $2,000. My family's income didn't really change but I am out-of-state.  Edit: forgot to answer your second question. Work-Study doesn't go directly towards tuition. It gets paid to you biweekly depending on how much you make/how many hrs you work. I mean you can pay that money back to the school to help with tuition but I think work-study is usually used to help with other expenses.
post,Degree,neutral,I‚Äôm applying to architecture school as a cross campus transfer student. When do they usually release decisions?
comment,Degree,negative,i think it should be april some time. but also every person that took the pre-reqs and used that work in the portfolio ended up getting into the program, so i wouldn‚Äôt stress about it too much
post,PSA,positive, Near Golfside/Clark in Ypsilanti  Today, my partner Oliver and I were greeted by a very sweet and very playful female dog at our apartment at The Villas in Ypsilanti. She had no collar or tags, but after chasing her for about a half-hour, we were able to get her onto a leash and called the Humane Society of Huron Valley to report a found dog. The Humane Society then sent out an officer from the Sheriff's department, who has taken her to HSHV to hunt for a microchip. Photos from just before her sheriff's car joyride can be seen here: [https://imgur.com/a/RsV0PtH](https://imgur.com/a/RsV0PtH)  She seemed very healthy and comfortable around humans, with no injuries. My partner and I are certain that she's someone's, and we just want to make sure she gets back to her humans safe and sound. She does respond to human voices (primarily mine, I'm a woman if that helps!), and was looking back at me every time I'd yell "pupper" or "honey." Those might be similar to her name?  If she looks familiar, PLEASE CALL THE HUMANE SOCIETY. She will likely be listed there as a stray.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm a computer science student deciding between Univ of Florida in state (7k) vs UMich out of state (51k)  Im a transfer student so it would be for 2 years.  So basically is a UMich CS degree worth 88k more than a UF degree?  I won‚Äôt be taking a loan, it will be my parents paying they make around 140k ish and have 400k in real estate and 200k in liquid assets.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Take the instate tuition. That‚Äôs a ton of money
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Florida for sure
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Not a CS student but paying 88k for any out of state school when there is a cheaper, just as good option probably isn‚Äôt worth it. Idk how Florida‚Äôs CS program is compared to Michigan‚Äôs, but Florida is a great school and I cannot imagine Michigan is worth 88k more than Florida.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Are you planning on/would you like to go to grad school? I feel like this isn't talked about as much but where you go to grad school can matter more than where you do your undergrad.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Florida. Umich is a better school but cs is growing at such a pace school isnt as big of a determinant as other fields. Make sure you get internships though
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If your parents want to cover it then I‚Äôd do it. 0 additional cost to you, better education? They might have a lot locked up in a 529 for you they want to use.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Look at the job prospects for that degree in both schools - what percentage of people are employed within 3 months after graduation, salary expectations, what companies are hiring, etc.  Unless Michigan is significantly better on those measures, just take the in state tuition.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you're parents are supportive go for it, though to be honest, out of state tuition really isn't worth it  UMich has a good reputation but it's still a public school with large lecture style teaching, and it's CS department can barely keep up with student demand. Expect to get a good education, but there will be large class sizes, limited student/faculty help, and difficultly securing classes  Personal recommendation is to stay in the nice weather of Florida rather than freezing in the Michigan Winter in North Campus
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,And the answer issss.....nope! Go to Florida
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Florida no question
post,Prospective Student,positive,Greetings! I have recently been admitted to the 2021 Fall term of UofM (confetti!). I wanted to study CS, so I applied for LSA.  Now, I'm unfamiliar with U.S colleges in general, and I live abroad so I do not have knowledgeable people around me to ask, nor do I know what to look for online.  Basically, it seems that all LSA students will take the same necessary courses, and will be able to select individual majors in Sophomor years.   Is this correct? If so, how do students go about to choosing their individual majors. If this is incorrect, how do students go about selecting their choice of major and what kinds of rules or caveats are there?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,There are certain requirements you have to meet to declare a CS-LSA major. You have to take EECS 183 or ENGIN 101. Then you have to take EECS 280/203 and MATH 115/116 and have a 2.5 GPA among those 4 classes. Then, you can meet with a CSE advisor to declare your major whenever you complete those requirements.  Here's a [link](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-lsa/) that explains the major. Make sure to download the program guide which gives very detailed guidelines for completing the major.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Yeah, this is correct. Most people don‚Äôt declare a major until their sophomore year. If you want to major in CS just make sure to take EECS 183 your first semester, all your other classes can be your gen eds
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Declaring a major, at least a Michigan, does not matter so much early on. By declaring CS in LSA you get access to some engineering or major-specific resources, so there's incentive to do it, but you don't have to stress too much.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Okay. So, you don't need to do anything related to your major before enrolling.  In your first two years at Michigan, you need to take specific classes called prerequisites, and these vary based on major. For example, for cognitive science you need to take COGSCI 200, for economics you need to take ECON 101/ECON 102 and MATH 115, and for computer science you need to take the courses that u/ChaoticPalmTree mentioned.   After you've taken those classes, you'll make an appointment with a CS advisor, which is a simple online process, and you'll spend 30 minutes talking to them about your plans to pursue computer science and classes you'll take to accomplish that. They'll change your major in the computer system from undeclared to computer science, and that's it.   This summer, when you do freshman orientation, you'll meet with an advisor and they can help you choose your classes for the 2021-2022 year so you can stay on track. So don't worry if you're still feeling a little confused.
post,Degree,positive,I‚Äôm taking Math 214 right now and it‚Äôs not too bad but it‚Äôs definitely not a class I enjoy material-wise. I‚Äôm planning on majoring in IOE, so I was wondering how much knowledge from Math 214 comes up in IOE courses. I know Math 214 is a pre-req for IOE, but I was curious to know what a current IOE student/recent graduate about how much linear algebra I‚Äôll be doing in the major.  Thanks!
comment,Degree,neutral,IOE 310 includes a refresher on the matrix math you need, or at least it does when Amy Cohn teaches it.   I earned a C- in Math 214 and hated the material. I liked my upper level classes in IOE and earned good grades in them.
comment,Degree,positive,You will be fine unless you want to be in grad school for Operations Research.  You can scrape by 310 with minimal Linear, and after that, choose-your-own-adventure with the 400s electives.  (Amy Cohn is a good point made elsewhere here, but 310 is getting passed around a lot more these days and I don't think she'll have it again anytime soon.  I've heard good things about the gentleman lined up for F21 based on his course this semester, his first at UM.)
comment,Degree,positive,Linear algebra also shows up in 316 and 366, as well as in 310. At least going by the course description (without looking at syllabus), each topic listed in Math 214 comes up in at least one of these courses.  I don‚Äôt know how much rigor 214 goes into in terms of proofs and derivations, but you definitely need to have ‚Äúworking knowledge‚Äù of these concepts, e.g., if you are asked whether a collection of vectors is linearly independent, you need to know what to do to check whether the answer is yes or no. The review at the beginning of an IOE class is useful as a refresher if it‚Äôs been a while and you are a bit rusty, but you need to have the foundation from 214.  If you are managing the class and are able to understand and use most of the concepts, but don‚Äôt feel too enthused by it, it means you made the right choice going into engineering rather than pure math ‚Äî in engineering, math can be just a means to an end. :-)
comment,Degree,positive,I‚Äôm also in your position, but in the IOE section for ENGR 100, they mentioned the optimization classes take material from linear algebra.
comment,Degree,positive,It‚Äôs most relevant for 316. Also useful for 310

post,New Student,positive, I was recently admitted as an incoming sophomore transfer student. I‚Äôm very covid-conscious, and I want to have my own space without a roommate. I explored my options in apartments, but most of the singles I could find were pretty expensive so I thought I‚Äôd look into the single dorms. However, I‚Äôm having trouble finding information about where on campus there are single dorms and how likely I am to get one. I don‚Äôt mind community bathrooms or anything, but I‚Äôd like my own room on central campus.  Do most residence halls have single dorms available? Am I likely to get one as an incoming sophomore transfer student?   Please no responses telling me you strongly recommend not getting a single because i‚Äôll become a hermit; I have friends on campus, including my girlfriend who I will be seeing often. I won‚Äôt be staying in my dorm 24/7. If it‚Äôs unlikely that i‚Äôll receive a single, I‚Äôll try to find somebody likeminded.
comment,New Student,positive,>Do most residence halls have single dorms available? Am I likely to get one as an incoming sophomore transfer student?  There's a wrinkle here and it means it may be hard for anyone to answer your question.  Next year, UM may be trying to limit residence hall capacity again (pandemic not being wholly over).  That means they are going to be stretched to house the freshman class and may not be able to offer as many rooms to students who are not freshmen.  On top of this, there are some number of sophomores who didn't get a residence hall experience at all in 2020-2021 as freshmen because they attended as remote students.  It's possible that some of them may be hoping to do that as sophomores, so the number of sophomores seeking a room on campus may be higher than usual.    For these reasons, it may be a little hard to tell whether information that applied in previous years will apply for Fall 2021.
comment,New Student,positive,Almost all dorms have both double and single dorms and you‚Äôre very likely to get them if you request one. I think you‚Äôre supposed to rank the dorms in order of preference so you should rank single as the top one.
comment,New Student,positive,>	most of the singles I could find were pretty expensive  Just wanted to note that single dorm rooms are also more expensive than double dorm rooms. I don‚Äôt know the exact discrepancy, but any living situation without roommates in Ann Arbor is gonna be on the pricey side.
comment,New Student,neutral,Stockwell is all sophomores and two thirds of the rooms are singles. Try to pick up a contract there if you can.
post,Housing,positive,Hello everyone, I really need your advice.   I haven't found housing yet for this summer class 2021. I am not sure whether I should stay in Airbnb by contracting month to month rental or find someone who is subleasing their Apt.   A quick note, I might also need a place to stay for Fall 2021 as well. It's my first time visiting Ann Arbor ever since I got accepted.  Kindly help here?   Thank you guys!!
comment,Housing,positive,I suggest subleasing  There aren‚Äôt really good enough long term Airbnb options here People will be subleasing their rooms at a heavy discount  Facebook/Craigslist You can easily find something for under 500$ a month in town
comment,Housing,neutral,There are usually way more people who want to sublease their room than people looking for summer housing especially if you aren‚Äôt too picky (high rises are very in demand but if you‚Äôre fine living in a house and/or with other housemates there is way more supply than demand). Tons of people in Facebook groups rn want someone to tale their rooms for the summer.
comment,Housing,positive,you should check out the coops! they have summer or spring only contract options and you can probably stay into the fall too if you‚Äôd like! the cost includes food too. the website is www.icc.coop and for spring / summer you can pick to have a single room etc
comment,Housing,positive, Thinking of subleasing my apartment. It‚Äôs like 10min from campus. One bedroom abs kitchen. Not sure when but if you message me details maybe we can help each other out
comment,Housing,positive,Are you taking spring term classes only, or both spring and summer terms? Subleases are quite cheap over the summer ($400/month can get you pretty much any student apartment for the summer), but most apartment complexes near campus have their leases end the first week of August, meaning you won't be able to stay past then.   If you're taking both spring and summer term classes, just be aware of this and try to find a sublet with a longer lease, or sublet somewhere and then get an Airbnb for August only. My friend stayed in UTowers during all of August, and I think Carriage House also has leases that last until the end of summer term. Most of the high-rises close in August, though. And I'm not sure about the rental houses--I guess it depends on the landlord for those.

comment,Miscellaneous,negative,I don't have a smartphone. I usually just take a picture of the ResponsiBLUE confirmation screen. Haven't had any problems doing that.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Just curious do you still have a regular phone
post,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôve been accepted to the 3 year Master of Architecture program. I‚Äôm still weighing other schools so if anyone would like to share their personal experiences/opinions of studying architecture at Michigan it would be greatly appreciated.   * Also any housing recommendations?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I am graduating the 3 year MArch this semester and have absolutely loved my time here  I think the first year of the program can be a handful but I think that‚Äôs true of any 3 year architecture program (having friends do the ones at USC and Yale)  Ann Arbor is an excellent place to live It‚Äôs such a collaborative environment and i think it‚Äôs the perfect place for grad school  Ann Arbor is like the perfect balance of big enough to have plenty to do but also the right size to meet people and do your work.  Also Michigan has way more initiatives and programming to tap into once you‚Äôre there  You‚Äôll also get a pretty global network as Michigan has the largest living alumni base out of any college. My peers have had no issue going to their target cities post grad.  Please message me if you have more questions!
post,Class,positive,Can we get honor coded if our labs look similar since we are allow to collab on the labs?
comment,Class,negative,buddy there's only so many times you can press q to kill all the wraiths :) AKA you should be fine 100%
comment,Class,positive,After perusing the syllabus it would seem that you should be okay as long as your code is not exactly the same.  It's been a while, but I can't imagine labs in 183 having a wide variety of solutions.
comment,Class,positive,In 183, there‚Äôs only like 2 maybe 3 max solutions for each lab you‚Äôll be fine lol
post,Parking,positive,Is it TOO MUCH to ask that y‚Äôall not take up two spots with your car???? Literally just pull up one more foot. There is no need for you to park in the CENTER of a kerbside parking space that can fit 2 cars!!!! Parking is already hard to find here, so can y‚Äôall not be dicks about what space we do have??  Sincerely, Someone who just parked 2 blocks away, for the nth time, because apparently people have no special awareness
comment,Parking,positive,Only 2 blocks away...man parking has gotten tons better
comment,Parking,neutral,kerbside
comment,Parking,positive,Oh they are aware. They do it to save a spot for a roommate or friend.
comment,Parking,negative,One of the only good things about COVID is that parking is now more plentiful.  Living near the hockey arena used to be a nightmare because the fans would rather steal residential parking spaces than pay a few bucks to park in the pain lot.  Football gamedays would also be awful.  It would also be annoying in the morning when commuters would park in residential areas before walking to class.  Don't make the same mistake I did and rent a house that has an adequate driveway so you don't need to worry about parking.
comment,Parking,negative,It would be nice if people parked as efficiently as legally allowable, but if spaces are unmarked, many people lack the knowledge or spatial sense to know where they can legally park. For example, they may think they need to park 10 feet from where a driveway's curb starts to curve, when it's actually 4 feet from where the driveway would intersect the road if its edge were extended straight to the road.  If there are no markings, you could ask the city to add some, although that's a long shot. If there were markings but they're mostly worn off, it's likelier they'll redo them soon if you report the wear to Ann Arbor's a2fixit.   Another option is to get some white spray paint and add your own markings. It's a crime, and a bit pricy if you actually get a decent asphalt marking paint, but would improve the situation substantially. Just draw L's and T's to demark the corner of legal spaces, like you can see on the [satellite view](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ann+Arbor,+MI,+USA/@42.2831972,-83.7395149,149m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x883cb00dd4431f33:0xdb09f94686c8b5e2!8m2!3d42.2808256!4d-83.7430378) of Catherine between Ingalls and State. If you make stencil cut-outs for L's and T's to do it well, it's less likely the city would notice and remove the markings.  Be sure and use a tape measure, make the spaces in keeping with the widths and lengths the city uses, and be careful to obey all the signs and laws on where you can't park:  >(1) On a sidewalk; or, on that portion of the highway located between the property lines and the curb or curb line;   >   >(2) In front of a public or private driveway, or within 4 feet of each side of such driveway with a curb cut, measured from the boundaries of said driveway as extended;   >   >(3) Within an intersection;   >   >(4) Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant; except when the operator remains in the vehicle;   >   >(5) On a crosswalk;   >   >(6) Within 20 feet of a crosswalk, or if none, then within 15 feet of the intersection of property lines at an intersection of streets or highways;   >   >(7) Within 30 feet upon the approach to any flashing beacon, stop sign, or traffic-control signal located at the side of a street or highway;   >   >(8) Within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing;   >   >(9) Within 20 feet of the driveway entrance to any fire station and on the side of a street opposite the entrance to any fire station within 75 feet of said entrance when properly signposted;   >   >(10) Alongside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction when such stopping, standing, or parking would obstruct traffic;   >   >(11) On the highway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street;   >   >(12) Upon any bridge or other elevated structure upon a street or highway;   >   >(13) Within 200 feet of an accident at which police officers are in attendance;   >   >(14) In front of any theater;   >   >(15) In any place or in any manner so as to block immediate egress from any emergency exit or exits, conspicuously marked as such, of buildings;   >   >(16) In any place or in any manner so as to block or hamper immediate use of and immediate egress from any fire escape, providing an emergency means of egress from any building.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello,   I‚Äôm currently a high school senior and received news on Friday that my LSA application for Fall 2021 was rejected üôÉ as such, I have been looking into all the possible routes I can take to try and get in as a transfer student. When looking at the LSA transfer recommendations, it is stated that successful transfers typically have ‚Äútwo or more semesters of graded college coursework‚Äù. Does this mean you have to have two semesters of college work on your transcript before you can even apply? Like could I not be enrolled as a sophomore because I would have to apply as a transfer around the same time I end just my first semester at another institution?
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,you can apply for fall 2022 because once your freshman year is done you‚Äôll have two full sems!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,It is possible, but don‚Äôt structure all your plans around getting in.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It's definitely doable if you want to transfer into LSA during your second year (can't say the same for Engineering or other smaller colleges). A caveat is that once you get here, you may still have to take a good number of freshman classes that you cannot get transferred credits for (e.g. First-Year Writing Requirements)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Personally, I was admitted to LSA as a transfer after only one semester of graded work. You have to have a minimum of two semesters completed when you enroll, but you can apply with only one semester completed. From what I've heard, they prefer junior transfers (45-60 ish transferable credits) but will accept less. They'll just weigh your high school stats a bit more if you're applying for your sophomore year. Feel free to message me, I'm happy to share my stats, essays, etc. Best of luck, and don't give up!!!!!!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I got rejected out of high school. Went to community college for 2 semesters but by the time I could apply after having those 2 semesters I was applying for the winter 2017 semester instead of fall 2016. It‚Äôs easier to transfer in than to get in out of high school. If you really want to go to Michigan you can go this route and work hard and you‚Äôll get in.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Not trying to bash on anyone in particular (mostly because I'm not really sure who to direct this at) but the handling of mental health issues on campus and as a whole recently is pretty funny to me. I had to an emergency/urgent crisis meeting with a CAPS rep. I'm not sure what their idea is of care. I spoke to someone who clearly was reading off a transcript, I assume some grad student practicing. Essentially, I was told to talk about what's going on (took like 35-45 minutes) then for the last 15ish minutes I was given basic coping mechanisms that I could have found by googling "how to stop being depressed/anxious). I'm not sure if this is normal or what. I definitely don't blame the dude I spoke to because I assume he was just trying to do his job. Its probably a good thing I spoke to this guy because I wasn't suicidal. If someone who wanted to die accidentally got paired with a robotic apathetic grad student during a serious crisis it could end awfully. I think I felt a little better after talking to the guy simply because it was so comical that a student crisis hotline was being manned by other students at this school who have lost interest in their work. I wish they would fund CAPS more, especially during this pandemic, so that these apathetic grad students can take care of smaller issues and problems and let licensed people deal with the serious mental health issues. Everyone is b\*\*\*\*ing about safety measures and testing (despite college students being one of the least likely groups to have serious implications from the disease) while serious mental health problems have quadrupled in the United States. I assume those numbers are likely worse for college students. Were just going to let people wallow away in isolation I guess; what a good holistic approach to community health. Also idk if its just my insurance, but 75% of the in-network therapists near here are 1)not accepting new patients and 2) over the age of 65. It honestly is a bit funny to me that when I finally get the strength to seek out help I have these types of issues. Does anyone have any good experiences with CAPS lately? or similar experiences. Or ideas on how to find help around Ann Arbor?  &#x200B;  EDIT: apparently the person I talked to was a phd. 
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,So, i had similar experiences with caps. They are unfortunately a band-aid for mental health, not equipped for more severe things.  As for therapists, its rough right now. Therapy is more popular in the last year than ever before so therapists are at capacity. My therapists unfortunately lost her battle with cancer late last year and I've been on the waiting list for 4 different therapists for 4 months. It's a difficult time for new patients
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I had an appointment with CAPS last week. I was given a list of therapists in Ann Arbor to contact. Since the semester is almost over and CAPS only helps students that are currently enrolled in classes, the therapist thought it was best I established care with someone else. I‚Äôve never really had good luck with CAPS.

comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Took a bit for me to find a therapist but I did but yeahh CAPS was somewaht helpful but they do give many googable things.  I'm really hoping therapy can help me because I am drowwnnninngg lol. I feel you on the therapy.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,It is difficult to find a therapist with availability to take new patients in Ann Arbor.  The pandemic has ratcheted up community needs.  I have had this experience myself, and also have heard from therapist friends that they are working grueling hours.  And you're right, it's the worst kind of funny that when someone gets the courage/motivation to seek help, they end up hitting barriers instead of getting what they need.  Sounds like you got connected with someone that either isn't good at this at all or was having a difficult day.  It is awful that your phone call went poorly.  I appreciate that you noted you couldn't tell whether this was normal or not--but then you flipped that, and assumed there are multiple "other students who have lost interest in their work" hired.  Let's hope that's not true.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I had therapy for a bit thru CAPS and I had a fine experience. I'm sorry that the emergency services weren't good :( I've always heard that CAPS (and therapy tbh) is a mixed bag, it really depends on who you get.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Hello, Packard health and community mental health provide low costs mental health services
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Hi! I‚Äôm on a task force for the university and OneU working on COVID-19 issues, specifically mental health. If you‚Äôre interested in sharing your experience and or any recommendations on what would‚Äôve been more helpful to you, feel free to DM me! (Same goes for those in the comments with similar experiences)
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello, I‚Äôm currently a high school senior who was just rejected from LSA :( I really love this school and have wanted to go here since 5 years old, so naturally, I‚Äôm looking into all of my options to try and get in as a transfer next year. I heard about the Michigan Transfer Agreement that many Community Colleges here in Michigan have with UofM to facilitate transfers, but I have a few burning questions. Has anyone had experience transferring through this program?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was in an early college program designed to fulfill the MTA before graduating with an associates degree and a high school diploma. I transferred 49 of my 61 credits to Umich. DM me if you have questions about the MTA!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I transferred from Jackson College here in Michigan. Feel free to ask any questions.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I, like another commenter, also attended an early middle college program. I transferred 58 credits to the University, and completed my associate's as well as fulfilled the MTA. Feel free to message me with any questions.    [This link has all of the accepted classes from the MTA specified for each community college.](https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/transfer-applicants/community-college-students/michigan-transfer-agreement) make sure you reference this because Michigan is a bit pickier than other universities. Not every MTA class is accepted.  You can also reference the [LSA Transfer Credit Equivalency website](https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu/) to ensure that all of the classes you intend on taking will transfer. (Trust me, retaking classes sucks!)  And just a reminder, you can only transfer 60 credits (62 with an associate's). I took 72 at cc, so I lost 14 credits in transferring, but I was still able to almost reach the max. I have also been able to petition a number of those to count as certain prerequisites, so just know that the system is a bit flexible.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I was accepted as an incoming freshman, but this is an out of state school for me and the tuition is frankly absurd. I would not be able to afford this school without assuming a large sum of debt, and the thought of that is already burdensome. On paper, this is the best school I got into.  So, honestly, would it be worth it for me to go if it means I would have to assume a large debt? Is the college experience at this school versus another actually that much better? Are the academics?  And yes I know the academics and college experience is and would be for me excellent, but my question is: Is it worth the debt?  TLDR: Best school I got into, is it worth going into debt for?  edit: grammar
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,No
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Do you know what career you want? Look at the salary of someone working a job in the FIRST YEAR, THAT'S NOT THE MEDIAN SALARY.   &#x200B;  Your total debt should not exceed that.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you feel the cost is absurd, then I think you already have your answer.  You wouldn't want to spend four years at a place you felt foolish for writing a tuition check to.  More thoughts to expand on that:  Everyone's cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.  For some, it would be worth assuming some reasonable amount of debt to attend.  But that's not true for everyone.  I think this is a great place, but you're not going to find it a great place if your foundational premise is that it's just not worth it.  A lot of people's college experience has some glitches--a bad class, an unfair professor, some weird bureaucratic thing that locks you out of that class you wanted, etc etc --you gotta be able to bounce back or shrug those things off, and I think that's a lot harder for someone who carries around a lot of questions about the value of what they are getting.  The quality difference between schools is sometimes exaggerated.  A smart person (that's you, right, you got admitted here) who chooses sensibly can have a good experience at a lot of campuses--not just the most selective/prestigious place they got admitted to!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,No undergraduate experience is worth considerable amounts of debt. This was true years ago when I was making this decision and it remains true today. I was offered the opportunity to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to Harvard, UChicago, and a few other "top" schools back in 2007 - I went to my in-state option for free. Three years later, I still got into a few top medical schools, including UM.   There are far too many excellent public state schools in the Midwest (and elsewhere) to bother paying a similar school (e.g. UM) a bazillion dollars when you're simply hunting for a bachelor's degree. This really holds true at most levels of academia; however, specific arguments can be made for spending more money later in training.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Did you submit FAFSA?
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Answer is no. Stop reading.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You don't want to look at "Best" perse. You want to optimize your benefit to cost ratio.   How to do this:   1 tally all your potential debt. This should be lesser or equal to one year of salary. For example, if you wanted to go into engineering, 60-70k of debt for your 4 years isn't a death sentence.   Conversely, if you did a major where your first year of salary was 40k. Then 60-70k of total debt is not wise. That's 1.5-1.75 debt/ to salary.      2. What is your major? Some majors, while a better name school may make it easier to climb the ladder, a good school can still benefit you. Using the engineering example again, a lot of people lament they need to go to the best school, but a "B" school has good prospects as well.  You may have to do some extra leg work, but there's no guarantee going to umich will land you that job anyway. Some of my humanities friends on the other hand came to this school because name is everything.   It's really hard to determine, without knowing your goals, majors etc...
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Easy to ignore the big number, not easy to pay it off when it becomes real. It will become real, and it's not worth it.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,If you have any vague interest for grad school then no, scholarships just aren‚Äôt common for grad school and the FASFA only gives loans as a grad student. So if you‚Äôre gonna likely squire loans in the future for that, don‚Äôt take out a million now if you can avoid it
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Maybe but maybe not? Depends on major and full situation. Some people take classes at a community college that have credits that can transfer over and then transfer to Umich later on.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,in state gang wya ? lol
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Honestly no. I was in your same position. I was accepted to UNC Chapel Hill, one of my top choices, but they were giving me pennies in comparison to their cost and I would end up over 160k in debt after graduating. My state school on the other hand is covering my full tuition and all I have to cover is room and board. Knowing that I will graduate with less than half the debt is worth not having the out-of-state college expirience.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey all! I got into LSA for this coming school year and I‚Äôm super pumped! I‚Äôm most likely going to be attending UMich but I had some questions about the vibe of the school.   -How do you like Ann Arbor? Personally, I really enjoy the big city feel and so I‚Äôm wondering how ‚Äúbusy‚Äù it feels: is there plenty of stuff to do around campus and places to go or does it feel like you have to travel to actual downtown to get any night life?   -How is the party scene? I‚Äôm not interested in joining a frat but I still have the ‚Äúwork hard, play hard‚Äù type of mentality. Are there lots of like Friday night/weekend options for a non-frat guy? Do you have any suggestions for clubs or extracurriculars to do that can help build a social network?   -How are dorms? Decent enough quality or should I be looking into off campus housing after freshman year?  -How‚Äôs the workload in general? Do you have free time on week days?  Thanks everyone!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. Always something to do, new foods to try, nature to hike in, etc. Like u/jmsouis mentioned, Ann Arbor and the University are largely integrated.  2. Party scene is great. Literally a party for any kind of person here. You just have to find the group of people you're comfortable with first, which takes a while in my experience. I would say 50-60% of people are work hard play hard type, as in grind all day and then go hard at night if time provides. For clubs and extracurriculars, I would recommend going for professional organizations (consulting, professional fraternities, project teams), and then strictly fun hobby organizations (M-run, Basketball Band, Casual Gaming Club, Squirrel-feeding).  3. Dorms are random. You either get placed in more run-down dorms or ones that are newer that actually include air-conditioning. No matter what, in my opinion, it's all about the people and friends you make. You will love your dorm if you vibe with the people. Like my friend says- "it's not about what you do, it's about who you do it with".  4. Workload based on your major, then your extracurricular commitments. I typically have free time 2 of 5 weekdays, but I would say this is one of my busiest semesters.   Feel free to ask anymore questions!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. there is *so much* to do in ann arbor. it‚Äôs not a large city, it has a small town feel. but that doesn‚Äôt hold any weight to the amount of things around campus. campus is directly next to downtown (you literally just need to cross the street), so theres a ton of restraunts and bars at your disposal. there‚Äôs also a few gems, like pinball pete‚Äôs. there‚Äôs a ton of parks nearby, and there‚Äôs the huron river for tubing in the summer. there‚Äôs also an amtrak station that directly connects to chicago.  2. there‚Äôs always a party going on. it‚Äôs easy to avoid if you‚Äôre not interested, but if you *are* them i guarantee you you‚Äôll be fine (once covid is over). there‚Äôs 1000+ clubs so i‚Äôm sure you can find something that suits your interests  3. dorms are decent enough. definitely stay in one your freshman year, because 97% of students do, and you‚Äôll get the college experience. they‚Äôre a bit small, and some dorms aren‚Äôt newly renovated (you can‚Äôt choose the building youre placed in), but it‚Äôs doable for a year without complaints.  4. depends on your major. as a premed student, i don‚Äôt remember the last time i wasn‚Äôt stressed. that being said, if you have good time management you should have plenty of free time
comment,Prospective Student,positive,if you‚Äôre looking for a cool work hard play hard scene for community living later i‚Äôd highly recommend checking out Luther, Nakamura and Michminnies co-ops! co-ed/gender neutral, affordable, not exclusive and have fun parties with live bands  every now and then!

comment,Miscellaneous,negative,anthony usually never remembers when he has one of these outbreaks unfortunately either, he used to come into espresso when i worked there and was always cordial and then one day screamed and threatened me and stole a bunch of stuff :/ Now he just says hi to me on the street in passing and tells me i look familiar, not threatening in the slightest in these cases. The police in ann arbor are familiar with him and some of the other individuals who are homeless in the area but won‚Äôt do anything to support them or their betterment so if anyone has other recommendations for who to call instead of the police that would be awesome

post,New Student,positive,Hey umich Reddit,   I'm a freshman international student moving into campus next semester since the classes won't be virtual anymore. I have some quick questions about visas since some peers recommended me to utilize Reddit to ask questions.   First, what should I do after I receive my F-2 visa? Are there procedures I have to know regarding when to move in and such?  Second, I am currently waiting for my certification email from the international center for my re-printing of my I-20. How long does it usually take? I sent mine about a week ago.   Third, I am aware that I cannot be vaccinated unless everyone with a greencard is vaccinated. Is that true?  &#x200B;  Thanks for your help. Been reading the posts for quite a while to get info on this school. I hope I am not in the wrong subreddit.
comment,New Student,positive,I am not an international student, so I can't help with the first two questions.  However, the [UM international center] (https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/getting-covid-19-vaccine) says you are eligible for the vaccine regardless of immigration status (after April 5th, or earlier if you meet other requirements). When I scheduled my vaccine appointment, I was never asked about immigration status.
comment,New Student,positive,If you are the student, you will be getting an F1 visa. After you get your visa, just come to the US. Make sure to not come earlier than 30 days before classes start. Then meet with your international advisor when you get here.  Edit: You'll need the I-20 to get through immigration and other stuff too. So make sure to bring all documents you could possibly need.
comment,New Student,positive,International student here. Once you get your visa and I-20, there‚Äôs really nothing you absolutely have to do. Monitor the CDC travel guidance for restrictions on international travel. Currently they require you to get tested a couple days before you come into the US but that might change.  The time it takes to make an I-20 depends on the backlog in the international center. Once they print it, it will take a week or so to get delivered. If you are a new student, pay attention to the program start date printed on your I-20. As others said, you can‚Äôt enter earlier than 30 days before that date. You‚Äôll also be invited for the international orientation later in the year. If you live in the dorms, that might make you eligible for early move-in. If you‚Äôre a current student, you can just enter before the semester starts. Make sure to check whether you need to meet with the international advisor after you come though.
post,Prospective Student,neutral,Has anyone done this program? Can they give any two cents on it?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I think there's two main benefits of this program.  1. If you believe you're wildly unprepared for college, M-Sci is a good way to dip your feet into college without completely drowning.  2. It's a really easy way to make friends. Many bridge/MSTEM students have already found a support system before the rest of their peers that start in the Fall. Although it might be different if MSTEM is all virtual this year due to covid.  There are definitely a lot of drawbacks to the program but it might not matter if it's virtual. When I was in the program, we had very little freedom and every minute of our summer was scheduled for us.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was in this program! It makes the transition to college much easier and less stressful, and a lot of M-STEM people make life long friendships. It can definitely set you up to succeed in your first year and introduce you to the workload of college, getting around campus, accessing research opportunities, and the like. [assuming it‚Äôs not virtual] you are giving up your summer before college to live at UM and start early, so that is a big drawback to consider!  I was really nervous before starting the program but I decided to do it and I am glad I did. It‚Äôs definitely intense, and I can definitely say that I wanted to go home very badly during the intense summer, but I made some great friends cause we were all in it together

comment,Sports,positive,On one hand, I loved the experience of the crowds and parties during the 2018 tournament run and want every student after me to experience that madness; on the other hand, this seems really irresponsible to do during a pandemic.
comment,Sports,positive,This is not pandemic-safe, not at all, and the majority of students haven‚Äôt had COVID-19 or been vaccinated.
comment,Sports,positive,This reminds me of last semester when the pictures of students partying circulated and next thing you know we were on a temporary lockdown. We all want things to be back to normal and be able to have fun and live our lives but this contributes to the narrative that the University is a primary contributor to Covid outbreaks in the larger Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County community. Ordinary citizens are not doing stuff like this.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Heya, I'm a freshman who will probably enroll in the fall and ever since I got injured I've been working as a swim coach which I want to continue in college. I was wondering if you guys knew if there were opportunities to do so since most swimming seems to happen in schools here. Obviously I can't work full time, so is it a realistic ambition?   I'm level 2 qualified in the UK and also a qualified lifeguard. I have like 3 years of experience at a relatively high level.   I know everyone says don't get a job in your first semester and all but I'm an international so I'm gonna need all the cash I can get bc tuitionüôÉüôÉ and I also love my job and don't really want to stop :)
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Try Goldfish Swim School or YMCA?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,A friend of mine has been a club swim coach for the last 3 years. He either coach‚Äôs super early in the morning or right after school  Issue for you would probably be lack of car. You‚Äôd 100% need a car to both get to practice on the regular and then go to meets around the state
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you‚Äôre talking seriously high level coaching, not teaching 8 year olds to doggy paddle, the org/ you want to get with are either the actual University Varsity Swim Team or Club Wolverine.   Michigan swim and dive is nationally competitive against other university teams and a produces Olympic level talent, for both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams. I‚Äôll assume your opportunity‚Äôs here would be more limited to equipment manager type positions since you don‚Äôt have any experience at a collegiate level.  Club Wolverine is a private club that exists as an affiliate of USA Swimming. They also have a strong program from youth through adult age groups. Most notably, Michael Phelps trained with Club Wolverine from 2004-2008 when his coach Bob Bowman took the job coaching Michigan Swimming, because his sponsorships prevented him from swimming for the university team.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,There are quite a few swim clubs in the area, but most of them are not as elite as you may be looking for, but they may be more likely to hire a college student who can only work part time. You could look into programs at YMCAs and others like them. If you will have access to a car, you can look outside of Ann Arbor as well, for example, I know people who have coached for the Milan Swim Club, which is about 10 miles south of A2.   I have taught lessons/coached/lifeguarded at a pool in a small town south of A2 my entire time at the University. It's definitely possible, just have to find a place that will work with your schedule!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,FYI OP, as an international student, you cannot work off-campus. So you can't coach for private clubs or the YMCA or similar entities. It sucks but you could get into serious troubles and it's not worth it in my opinion. The CCRB and NCRB may hire coaches though, I have friends who have gotten swim lessons there. But they probably don't pay as well.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi! I‚Äôm an incoming freshman and I got into Electrical Engineering in Warren College at UCSD. I also got into college of engineering at Umich.(undergrad)   I‚Äôve been having a hard time deciding between the two and i‚Äôm hoping you guys can help me out with a few of my questions. Even if you don‚Äôt know much about the Umich pls feel free to comment.   In general, how good are the profs at Umich or is it just a mixed bag like basically every other uni?   How good/helpful is the careers department in helping you get internships and would you say being in cali is a massive advantage for finding internships and jobs in tech?   Are the reputations of either school significant when applying for jobs and if so which school has the better rep?   How easy is it to make friends and are there school events, parties etc. to help with socialising? Also what is there to do in general off campus?   How good and affordable is the food in the area and also what‚Äôs the quality and variety of food in the dining halls like?  What is public transportation like? If staying off campus would I need a car to get around?   I‚Äôve grown up in a semi arid climate( hot and dry for much of the year with mil) so going to ucsd wouldn‚Äôt be too different from what i‚Äôm used to. I‚Äôve read that long cold dark winters like in ann arbor can cause seasonal depression. So have any of you lived in such places and if so how badly does the weather affect you and do you think it should be an important factor to consider when deciding on uni?   If you have anything else to add to help me pls don‚Äôt hesitate to mention it!   Thank you in advance, much appreciated. :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. i cant speak for the electrical engineering department but in general it‚Äôs a mixed bag just like every other university  2. the career departments here are great. getting internships is a regular thing here  3. in my opinion, umich has the better rep simply because of our alumni network 4. it‚Äôs very easy if you put yourself out there and don‚Äôt stay in your room 24/7. theres a ton of clubs (like 1000+). and there‚Äôs always a party happening somewhere. off campus, there‚Äôs a lot of parks to explore (i highly suggest tubing down the huron river in the summer), a ton of restaurants, and some little gems like pinball pete‚Äôs. there‚Äôs also an amtrak station that connects directly to chicago  5. the food can be on the more expensive side, as ann arbor is in general. but you get what you pay for, the quality is amazing. as for the dining hall, it‚Äôs decent. it‚Äôs definitely not gourmet, but it‚Äôs something you can live on for a year or two without complaint  6. do not bring a car. parking is horrendous and ann arbor has great public transport. the blue bus is entirely free and gets you anywhere on campus and in the immediate surrounding areas. outside of campus, the ann arbor bus system is also free to students  7. yup seasonal depression is a thing. maybe it‚Äôs because i grew up in michigan, but i barely notice it. invest in a sun lamp if it gets bad, and get some good snow boots and a coat and you should be fine. i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something to seriously weigh in your decision, but that‚Äôs just me
post,Degree,positive,Hey, I‚Äôm just admitted as a transfer student of CoE. Actually, I was accepted as a major in mechanical engineering, but I want to change my major to CS or ECE. Could it be possible to switch my major as a transfer student? I am a little worried that there is no guarantee to switch into CS major because of no space for transfer students.
comment,Degree,positive,Pretty sure you'd have no problems doing that if transfer students are under the same rules as other undergrads.  CoE doesn't treat declaring/switching to EECS any differently from other CoE majors (they don't place a cap on # of people or anything like that). Just sign up for some EECS classes once you're here, and schedule an advising appointment with CSE department (if switching to CS) or ECE department (if switching to EE/CE).
comment,Degree,positive,You have to wait one term. See below and link:  "Transfer students are admitted to a particular department and are expected to remain in the program they were admitted to, for a minimum of one semester."  https://www.engin.umich.edu/admissions/undergrad/transfer-students/apply/
post,Housing,positive,Has anyone successfully been able to terminate their Munger contract pre-COVID? I'll be graduating in the Fall and ideally would like to renew my lease, however supposedly graduating early isn't a good enough reason to terminate my contract.

post,Housing,positive,Hi everyone! I'll be a grad student this fall studying robotics (I'm assuming most if not all will be on north campus either in the engineering/robotics buildings). I've heard it can be isolating to live near north campus and was wondering if it would be a hassle to live near central campus (e.g. Kerrytown) but commute to north campus for classes? Are there bus routes that go straight from residential areas near downtown to north campus? I'm really new to AA so any insight would be great, thanks!
comment,Housing,neutral,check out baker coop! it‚Äôs a graduate student coop and about a 8 minute walk to the central bus station which would then be a 10-15 minute bus ride to north. pros is living with other grad students and getting to know them at home while being on central near a lot of restaurants/bars etc!
comment,Housing,positive,Most engineering students live on central campus. The commute is easy, buses run all over and on short intervals
comment,Housing,positive,I think some of it will come down to personality If you want to be able to walk out of your lab at a late hour and be home ASAP live on north If you like having shops and things to do that are non academic live by central.
comment,Housing,negative,It'd be a trek every day to class for sure, absolutely hated going down to central for class during my first year. But I also dislike the crowded busses, so I can't really speak to what it's like now. North campus isn't isolating if you actually try and socialize. People are just more spread out and thus you're less likely to run into people. I've never lived on central campus but I've stayed with friends on central many times and never actually saw any difference in effort to socialize. Just get people's snapchat and message them if you want to get food that's my trick.  Depending on what year you are your classes might not be in the respective building. Hell I've taken 300 level aerospace engineering classes in the eecs building.
post,Prospective Student,negative,I got accepted as a sophmore (maybe juinior??) from a community college with a 4.0. I hear that UofM is a very challenging school and grade inflation is nonexistent. This is a little bit alarming as I am an extremely lazy and I think there were maybe 5 projects in total I ever started more than a day in advance of the deadline during my entire first two years at college. Despite this, I have always pulled through at the last minute. After some lurking, I get the impression that is not going to fly and tbh I am a little worried. I also sleep 10 hours every night and usually wake up after noon, any tips for improving? I am legit the laziest person I know and the only one in my entire extended family who's ever gotten into anything even approaching a selective college.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,First of all, congrats! I got rejected from mich for undergrad, and now I‚Äôm doing my masters here. I am very similar to you in that my entire undergrad, I did everything last minute. My undergrad institution was definitely not as hard as Michigan, but here are a few things that I recommend:   1. Try to schedule your classes in the afternoon. There‚Äôs always people who say ‚Äúmorning classes are better because I have the whole day after, blah blah blah‚Äù. But you know yourself well enough to know that morning classes just aren‚Äôt it. I had only 2 9:30am classes in undergrad and I probably went to 50% or less of the lectures because it‚Äôs just not how I operate. I typically tried to schedule my classes for 11am or later and it worked for the most part. The only I took the two earlier classes was because that was the only time they were offered.   2. Get a good planner. I may not be an early bird, and I do procrastinate, but I‚Äôm still organized. When you get your syllabi, put all the due dates in your planner that day. That way you don‚Äôt procrastinate it. It might not make you start things earlier, but you‚Äôll definitely be aware of your assignments and due dates.   Then, cross things off once they are submitted. Seeing the things that I have completed help me to see that I am accomplishing things, and seeing the list get smaller and smaller makes me feel less stressed.   3. Use your time between classes. Instead of going home or just going somewhere to hang out between classes, try to do as much work in the hour/ couple of hours between classes as you can. I would do little assignments here and there between classes that way I could focus on the bigger things at home and for longer. You could also use the time between classes to start projects and gradually work on them.   For example, say you have an hour break on Tuesday/Thursday... if you do a little work on a big paper or project for an hour for two days a week you will have more done when you sit down to crank it out before the deadline.   4. Start projects early, even if you do the little things. I know this is what you were worried about from the OP but even just picking a topic and making an outline were small things I could do early that made the big projects a little less intimidating.    I know these are pretty general tips, but they are all things that helped me through my undergrad. Good luck!!  Edit: as someone above said, use your resources!!! If you need help, go to office hours, email your professor, etc. This also helps your professor to know who you are and see that you are putting in an effort.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,I was lazy as hell in high school. Your current work ethic will not cut it here. I don't really know what tips to give besides taking advantage of the resources at your disposal (office hours, study groups, etc.). Also, don't procrastinate. You will just set yourself up for failure.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm also lazy and I've found that I'm more productive when I moved myself to a library or something. When I'm at home I can't really go more than 30 minutes on a project without getting distracted (unless it's the day it's due lol), but when I'm at a library I can go for hours.  I'd usually go mon-thur 5/6pm to close and would usually be able to finish almost all of my assignments or project work in that block cause I wasn't distracted, then I'd have the weekend and friday pretty open.  Obviously with covid this isn't possible, but something to keep in mind when stuff opens back up. I liked the Hatcher ref room because it was a no-talking zone but there was enough low noise of papers turning, keyboard tapping, etc for it to not be eerily quiet or anything.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,depends on your major I think. if, for example, you‚Äôll be doing a lot of essays, I think you could still crank them out near the deadline, but for project-based classes (if you‚Äôre in EECS, for example) then starting projects near the deadline is way too stressful and it‚Äôs easy to get stuck and not be able to pull yourself out/ require office hours. And if u start the projects too late, the office hour queues are too long and you might not be able to finish unless you are an amazing coder. so I think it depends a ton on your major and the type of classes you‚Äôll be taking
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If it works for you it works, IMO. Maybe at some point you'll fuck something up and you'll adjust accordingly, you just need to know your limits. Not everyone needs to put in the same amount of work to get the same result and your mental health is important. If it helps, you're far from alone in your experience.  But academics is only a small part of college. Don't be lazy with other things and use the time you save on academics wisely.

post,Class,positive,So I was wondering what % of questions, usually speaking does it take to get a B- or higher in an exam? I keep taking practice tests and I have been hitting in the high 50s low-mid 60%s range and was wondering what that would come out to be grade letter wise.
comment,Class,positive,Exam Shop lists the medians for all the past exams. Take a look there, especially if you are taking the old exams as practice tests as they are. Generally speaking the median is between 50 and 75 (I know, it's a large range and not that useful). And generally that median will equate to a B
post,Prospective Student,negative,I was accepted EA to LSA. I am a premed/predental student. Based on the research i have done, i've noticed that the premed courses are extremely difficult and kill gpa. Although I know that these classes will 100% prepare me for the MCAT/DAT and med school, I don't want to ruin my gpa (i know that sounds stupid but it's still a worry for me) which will ultimately ruin my confidence in pursuing after med school. I am receiving a ton of aid which i feel like is an offer i cant pass up on. The other school i am looking at is UAB. They also have a great premed program and it will be absolutely free for me. But i feel like the prestige of UMICH is just different. I don't wanna make a decision based on other people's judgement either. Every doctor i've shadowed have gone to undergrad schools that I have not even heard of for the most part, so i know it doesn't matter that much. But ultimately, I just wanna know how difficult those premed classes at umich are and whether it's even worth it for med/dental school.   Thank you if anyone answers!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It completely depends on the class and if you had any AP/ IB / DUAL ENROLLMENT credits (even if u aren‚Äôt gonna use the credits even having exposure to the material is super helpful). As you would expect the intro classes have more of a ‚Äúweeder‚Äù kind of reputation for the most part and the upper levels imo (and in my personal experience) have been less stressful and more learning focused rather than profs trying to be super hung up on specific details. Overall, as long as you are ready to put in the work , I don‚Äôt think the courses were unreasonable
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hey, I'm a premed sophomore right now and I will say that most of the premed classes aren't going to be anywhere near as hard as you think they'll be when you're first starting out. Michigan definitely deflates grades but med school admissions depts understand that and it's not like you're not going to med school because you got a 3.5 at UofM instead of a 3.7 at a less selective university. Also, I'd definitely recommend joining some kind of premed organization like a club, professional frat, or just a social greek house with a lot of premed students. The resources I've gotten from other premeds have been invaluable so far.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I have always been skeptical that university admissions committees weigh gpas from umich higher than other similarly sized schools. Some of the smartest and most hard working people I know ended up at state, grand valley, etc. It's going to be a hard learning curve regardless. For the most part you'll get good professors, but its inevitable that you get some who are just aggrivating. I won't sugar coat it, many of the prehealth courses are very difficult, and its the status quo in a lot of them to see exam averages in the 70% range and sometimes below (which is jarring for most students here as they were probably top of their class in highschool). When it comes time to take the mcat/dat you'll end up using the same resources as everybody else taking those exams to study. I
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Funnily, I live in Birmingham, and family works in medicine at UAB. UM is prestigious, but I guess it depends on what you actually want to do. I'm only a UG, so I don't really know much about medicine from an educational point of view, but UAB serves everyone in Alabama and even a massive amount of people in MS, TN, GA, etc. It's one of the largest medical centers in the Southeast. From doctors that I've talked to here, it sounds like you would get a lot of hands on experience (not sure at a UG level, though). Can't speak much for the actual programs, sorry, but can answer any of your questions about the city/state though (unless, of course, you live here)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I think they're quite challenging but doable. I don't consider myself naturally talented when it comes to science classes so it's been a lot of work. But even still, I've gotten pretty good grades. Freshman year was def the worst. I didn't really understand how to study and how exams work so I just ended up doing a lot of pointless stuff, wasting my time, and not getting very good results. Since then I've gone to take harder classes but I've gotten better grades too. Not sure if this answers your question, but I think doing well in STEM classes is very possible if you really want to.  Also, don't go into classes just thinking it's gonna be hard, that sets the wrong tone. This semester I've tried to be genuinely interested in my classes and I think it's helped my grades.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Here are my thoughts :)  1. It is not stupid at all to mind your GPA if you're pre-med or pre-dental. In fact, I'd say it's one of those things that you want to do right the first time, as it is really hard to get your GPA back up again if after a few years you realize that your GPA is too low for whatever school you're trying to apply 2. It is possible to do well here. I'd take the comment that medschools understand that a 3.5 at umich is worth more than a 3.7 at another lower ranked 4-year institution with a large grain of salt. If you're looking at medschools you should aim for a *minimum* of  >3.5 regardless of your major / institution (so choose wisely) 3. Medschools don't care about the prestige of your undergrad (if you went to Harvard or Yale or something Ivy-tier it \*might\* give you a leg up, but don't count on it). I'd recommend setting aside the UAB vs umich prestige thing aside just for a bit and instead look at where you'll be happy for the next 4 years and what opportunities (undergraduate research and student clubs) each one has. 4. Try to graduate undergrad with minimal debt, you'll really be racking those up in medschool unless you're one of the lucky few that gets full-rides   Good luck! Am a current premed here in my last year. Feel free to dm me :)

comment,Sports,positive,I admire this effort. I remember during my freshman year, one of my professors extended a paper deadline for the whole class after umich won a basketball game (that big one when everyone ran into the streets of south u) saying it was to give us time to "celebrate Michigan hoops".

post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm a prospective student planning to enroll in the fall. How easy is it to get a job on campus and how flexible are the hours usually? Is it realistic to aim to get a job my first semester?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Working at the dining halls or library is super easy, there are lots of other jobs on the student employment page but some might come with prereqs to apply like being a certain year/major etc. Although I personally wouldn't recommend getting a job your very first semester because you're likely going to be overwhelmed with classes and will want to spend most of your time focusing on school, making new friends, going to club meetings, etc. You can get jobs at the library/dining halls basically at any time so its not difficult at all to get a job on campus your second semester. My freshman year I waited to get my first job until second semester and it made everything a lot more manageable because I had already developed a good study routine and time management skills.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I plan on transferring to umich and in highschool i took a couple of HL classes which would allow me a few credits at umich, but I‚Äôm unsure if umich would accept them? I heard for schools like UCSD, they don‚Äôt accept ib grades that are older than a year.Does anyone know?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I transferred in fall 2019 and my IB scores were turned into transfer credits without much issue. The process was pretty much automatic for any IB/AP credit. The more troublesome one is transferring your college credits as you might be required to personally request for those transfer credits through the respective schools.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/ap-ib-credit/ib-guidelines  This should give you an idea of what they accept. I didn‚Äôt have any trouble when it came to receiving credit personally, so it seems pretty straightforward.

post,Housing,positive,I'm moving to AA for the summer and looking for a place to stay.  Preferably somewhere downtown, but I'm open to anywhere in the area.

post,Health / Wellness,positive,Following the weightlifting post from someone else on this sub... I‚Äôve gotten into powerlifting before Covid and while training was halted pretty much for a while, I‚Äôve gotten back to my groove and will be competing for the 2nd time mid-April. But I currently train in Plymouth and wanted to use my resources at NCRB maybe.  I saw that there was a Powerlifting Club here but apparently, no one will answer those emails.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I was accepted to LSA in January and applied to scholarships at the beginning of February. I haven't heard back about any scholarships and was wondering if any other EA admitted students have. Did I just not get any or have decisions not been made yet? I'm kind of scared because as an OOS student I barely got any aid and will only be able to attend if I get a scholarship.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Iirc, that information comes out in July

post,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm having a hard time of seeing a difference between there two programs or you could even call it one? The only difference I‚Äôve noticed was that for lsa you need to take 4 semesters of a foreign language class. Are there any benefits of doing one over the other?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The main difference between the two are the general education credits. Here is the [official page with the differences between the two. ](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-lsa-vs-computer-science-engineering/) You can also look at the two pages specific for each one on the left column  Edit: I‚Äôm currently in the college of engineering and plan on majoring in CS
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I did CS-LSA. Besides for the intro CS class, all of the other CS classes are the same for both. You can also get into the engineering career fairs either way and both look good on a resume.   The biggest difference is the other requirements outside of CS. Like LSA has a language requirement and it requires more humanities and social science credits. CSE requires more math and physics, etc. So the deciding factor IMO should be what your other interests are outside of CS. Like if you might want to get a minor, it‚Äôs a lot easier if you‚Äôre already in the school with that program.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Some people say CSE looks better I personally don't think it makes a big difference (same major from same university lol) and I believe it might be slightly more selective, for transfers I know it is for sure. The big difference really tho is the different Gen-Ed's for engineering vs. LSA. The engineering core requires you to take more math and physics, and those additional math classes can prepare you for several of the popular upper level computer science electives (machine learning is a big one),  or for a double major with another engineering discipline. The LSA curriculum might work better for minors outside of engineering (math, economics, statistics are popular minors for CS) because it has more flexibility with the non-major classes. In terms of jobs in the future, I heard one CSE guy say one time that it might make a difference just for your first job out of college but that's a biased source, the vast majority of people who look at your resume or transcript are gonna see "Majored in computer science and went to University of Michigan" you can beef up your resume with other stuff regardless of which one works out for you.
post,Prospective Student,neutral,As a chemical engineer, when will I start to have classes up in the North Campus? Is it in freshman or sophomore or even junior year?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,More than likely, you'll only have a couple classes on North in your freshman year, but as you progress further, you'll start seeing a lot more time up there
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As a sophomore in ChE right now, I can give a rundown of what my schedule has looked like in the past couple years and what it will look like for the future.     Depending on how many credits you come in with and how many pre-requisites you can knock out, some of this is likely to be a bit different, but not by much. Freshman year, I had two classes on North Campus each semester, one being the introductory engineering classes and the other being my UROP session (which is entirely optional on if you want to try out research or not). The rest of my classes that year were on central, which you will likely experience for at least your first two years but maybe even longer depending on how you map out your four-year plan. Knocking out all those math, physics, and chemistry general pre-requisites for the CoE takes time.     The same pattern happened for sophomore year. Last semester I had ChE 230 and MSE 220 but I also had two other classes that would have been on central, those being Econ 101 and Math 215. This semester it's two ChE classes and two other classes that again would have been on central. As I look at the rest of my four-year plan and what classes I have, the spread is looking to be about the same. Senior year is definitely more major-concentrated so you'd likely be spending more time on north by then.     General rundown, you'll at least spend a couple to a few hours on north MWF (since most lectures take place on those days) as a bare minimum to take classes, with an hour or two on Tuesday or Thursday for a lab or discussion. How much time you spend there besides for classes is entirely up to you. Do you like studying on central or on north? Are you going to have any commitments to Wilson Center teams or other engineering related organizations? It doesn't really matter where you live, whether it be on central or on north. Pick whichever one you like. I prefer central to north, and I've been able to live there for all my time here.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Everything that was said about classes is totally right, but another thing to consider is engineering extracurriculars. I‚Äôm working in a lab on north and I end up going up there 4 days a week for that.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Chemical engineering alum here, unless the curriculum has changed expect about 1 course per semester freshman year (Engineering 100/101) then about 2 courses per semester every other year on average. For the first 3 semesters of ChE the classes are only available in either fall or winter (mass and energy balances is only available in the fall, fluids and thermo are only available in the winter, etc.) Once you get to second semester junior year the courses are offered both fall and winter to give students more flexibility for things like co-ops
post,Degree,positive,I‚Äôve been constantly trying to dodge math throughout my college career, but recently I‚Äôve realized that a lot of things like machine learning or computer vision require linear algebra. Is linear algebra something I will definitely find useful in future careers? I don‚Äôt feel like taking a math class just for a class or two but if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll need in the future I‚Äôm highly considering to take it.
comment,Degree,positive,At U of M, if you want to take Introduction to Autonomous Robotics, Computer Vision, Introduction to Machine Learning, Autonomous Robotics, Data Mining, which are EECS 367, 442, 445, 467, 476,  Linear Algebra is a prerequisite. You can take 214 which is Applied Linear Algebra which doesn't involve mathematical proof like 217 which I assume is more for math majors.
comment,Degree,positive,This really depends on what type of career you want. For ML/CV yes, linear algebra is used very heavily to speed up calculations. If you wanted to work on an operating system, maybe not so much. If you're not a fan of math, maybe that just means an ML path wouldn't be the best fit; there's nothing wrong with that. There are plenty of ways to apply a CS degree.  Linear Algebra on its own likely won't be enough to go far in ML or CV either. If you've been avoiding math, know that EECS 445 is more math class than programming class.
comment,Degree,positive,If you want to go for grad school, then it is a must along with deep understanding of calculus.   For industrial jobs, especially entry levels, you won‚Äôt need much unless you‚Äôre very closely related with Ml (even not for CV).   However, if you want more confidence in performing your work (operating system does use eigenvalues sometimes), you need it.   In fact, what you really need is not linear algebra but applied linear algebra or matrix algebra. Consider 214 or 417, which I believe they are best fits for engineers. Matrices are no different from the equations in HS algebra if you have exposure of it and that is why some people call it matrix algebra. (This algebra is different from the field ‚ÄòAlgebra‚Äô in pure math).   Shortly, highly recommend it !
comment,Degree,negative,If you want to take classes that require linear algebra but don‚Äôt wanna take math at u of m cause it‚Äôs more stressful or expensive or will hurt your gpa, TAKE AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE!!! I‚Äôm doing that this summer and it‚Äôs much less stressful to not have it hurt your Gpa.
comment,Degree,positive,You should not only take linear algebra, but understand it too. I didn't like it very much but finally figured out how it all worked cramming for the final exam. Turns out it is used pretty heavily in graphics programming - 2D, 3D, image compression, etc. Want to rotate a space ship in a game? That's linear algebra. Create a dither pattern in a paint app? Linear algebra.        I'm sure many programmers don't really understand it and simply use 3rd party libraries to do the work, but when it comes time to debug the code it's best to have an understanding of the fundamentals.
comment,Degree,positive,Old alum here, and perhaps my perspective is out of touch with new job trends, but I'd guess for 95+% of professional programmers, linear algebra won't be directly useful in their entire career. I actually think the same is true about most other basic math and science requirements, beyond arithmetic and a little algebra.   There are areas of programming where linear algebra is vital, day in and day out, and I think other posts in this thread do a good job describing some of them, but there are also an *enormous* number of mundane programming jobs dealing with basic data storage, retrieval, and reporting. That's why coding boot camps exist, teaching narrowly focused skills.   The university's curriculum is designed to provide a rounded base of understanding so you're prepared for a wide range of areas within the profession. With optional courses, I'd generally steer toward topics that interest you, or are prereqs for topics that interest you.
comment,Degree,neutral,Linear algebra is required for a cs degree
comment,Degree,neutral,I can only really speak to EECS 445 (Machine learning) but it's def needed. There is a solid amount of proofs you do on hw and exams and i don't even think u can take the class without linear.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Does anybody have any experience with the CEW+ emergency funding or any other resources that might be able to help me get emergency/restorative dental work done? (above and beyond normal fillings and cleanings) I have no dental or health insurance and no family financial support.  I am a fulltime undergrad student living off of go blue guarantee and am very tightly budgeted for this semester, I have a paid internship starting in May but have no income until then and basically this really sucks and I'm not sure what to do, I know the school isn't really directly involved in students' health care but I want to see if there's any resources to help or anyone who has experience with these resources, my dental problems are pretty severe and I know the U of M dental school is the cheapest place to go and I'm totally fine with that, do you think the emergency funding sources could help? I think they would have to adjust my cost of attendance with the financial aid office which I'm kinda scared about because I don't want to do anything to rock the boat or jeopardize my financial aid.  &#x200B;  Sorry to rant but damn I feel like I'm doing everything I can to be a good person and I'm doing really well in school, but it kinda sucks when everyone constantly tells you you're gonna make bank after college but you can't even afford to go to the doctor or dentist when you need to :/
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,You should qualify for Medicaid, which covers basic treatment like yearly exams, radiographs, cleanings, fillings, extractions, etc.  The dental school doesn't really offer payment plans for basic/emergent treatment but you can speak to their billing office after you have a treatment plan.  I'm a DDS who went to Michigan if you have questions.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,UHS can help you find insurance that might work. If you qualify for Medicaid they can help you sign up. I also know the Dental school has a financing office so you can call the school and talk to them about options, probably after an evaluation. CEW+ and Dean of Students offer emergency funding, but be aware it counts against your financial aid eligibility. I believe I lost half a semester of aid for getting a few hundred from Dean of Students at some point, not sure if that's changed.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Visit the CEW+ website and reach out to them via email. Include as much detail as possible and give them your uniqname and student ID.
post,Student Organization,positive,So I've been accepted to RC and on my WISE app I indicated that I've been accepted to RC...will this effect my chance of getting into WISE? Since only non residential MLC's can be done with RC. I'm willing to opt out of RC if I get into WISE !
comment,Student Organization,neutral,perhaps send them an email, and try not to mention you have another choice next time lololol
comment,Student Organization,positive,Probably not, WISE is pretty easy to get into, and has far less commitments than some other residential programs (only one 1 credit seminar and minimal other things). In my opinion it's better for people looking more for a social community (not academic), so I'd keep that in mind when deciding between them. (I was in it freshman year, not really my vibe but I know a lot of people who really enjoyed it)
post,Event,neutral,I went to this dinner but I was wondering how students are chosen? Is it random?
comment,Event,positive,i went last year and sat with Alec Gallimore who is the dean of engineering here. he said to the other prospective student sitting at my table that his understanding on how people were chosen was based on uofm wanting these students to chose michigan. that's poorly worded, but maybe a lot of the students they chose were assumed to have other offers from other top schools? idk lol wasn't necessarily the case for me. there were students out of state that flew out to go to the dinner. wear something nice if you go, and congrats on getting in üíôüíô edit: i felt underdressed lol it was very formal
comment,Event,neutral,Is this some sort of humble brag?
comment,Event,positive,Yeah, it's just to honor students who got academic scholarships. The food was amazing when I went. Best chocolate cake I've ever had.
comment,Event,neutral,I also went to this dinner and I heard from some people that it was for students that received scholarships... I ended up getting one so I think that might have been it?
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Could someone teach me how to snatch and clean & jerk at umich gyms? Totally willing to pay for quality instruction!  Does umich have any coaches that could help me out?  &#x200B;  Edit: Should have mentioned that I am a 2018 alum. Not a current student.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Try connecting with UMich Muscle Club. The easiest way without knowing someone in it would probably be liking their insta [https://www.instagram.com/michiganmuscleclub/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/michiganmuscleclub/?hl=en)  I was briefly a part of it and there's a lotta emphasis on education and community, zero doubt someone'll help you out, generally has a range of people from newbies to competitives
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,there's a umich weightlifting club which i think has cheaper dues than typical oly coaching. it's tryout based, so if you don't have some existing strength base (or at least propensity to learn / coachability) that might not be the best avenue.   i would not go through recsports, unless you can find a PT who's actually got like an AO/uni nats qualifying total, and hopefully not the Z session.  if you have experience lifting / following structure programming, you can probably make do self-coaching with resources like juggernaut training system, catalyst athletics
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,@umichweightlifting on instagram. We are THE Olympic Weightlifting Team at UMich and are really the only place for university-based olympic weightlifting coaching.  I wish you posted this sooner as we just took new  members during this past tryout.  You should definitely follow us regardless to stay tuned on what‚Äôs next!
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Maybe the personal training service through RecSports?   https://recsports.umich.edu/training/
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi guys,   I got into UMich yesterday and I am wondering about the LSA honors college. I read that the honors students are given access to special classes and additional advising as well as a thesis project as upperclassmen. Are there real advantages to the honors college, or would it be just as easy to differentiate myself in other ways than going through yet another application process?   Thanks
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Tbh most people drop honors going into junior year, but i would apply so you can get south quad housing freshmen year. I would treat it like an opportunity, but don‚Äôt feel obligated to finish the program after sophomore year if you don‚Äôt want to
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It‚Äôs actually not a college, but an honors program for students within the College of LSA.   If you search the subreddit, there are a ton of posts on LSA Honors.   Congrats on your admission!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,One other perk is that advising appointments were much easier to get if you were in the honors program. And the honors lounge area has a couple quiet spots good for phone interviews.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Do it to get south quad. That‚Äôs it. Nothing else is really worth it that much.
post,Prospective Student,positive,International student here, who's probably coming to UM in the fall. Just wondering\^\^. I know UM is a huge school, but I guess I was a little worried about friends, especially because its so important to have a supportive community when you're far from home.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As long as you put yourself out there like joining clubs you're interested in or meeting others in your classes, it shouldn't be too hard to make some friends.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Depending on the usual influx of international students from your country, you can likely find a ‚Äú[Country/Community] Student Association‚Äù. Furthermore in my experience international students tend to support each other and stick together. As an international student, some of my closest friends are other international students. Other than clubs, classes, and cultural orgs, friends you meet in environments like dorms, parties, sports events, and other occurrences are totally random and luck based. If you want a close knit group that will always support you, I suggest finding and  reaching out to other students from your country attending Umich, I find that students from my home country to be the most reliable and best source of support. Feel free to DM me if you need help finding a cultural org from your home country/ region.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Clubs and dorms are a great way to make friends. I‚Äôm personally from out of state and no one from my high school went to u of m but i made friends through hanging out in the lounge of my hall in my dorm and introducing myself to people in my dorm, and getting involved a student org
comment,Prospective Student,negative,There is a giant community of internationals, don‚Äôt worry
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Depending on where you‚Äôre from, you may find other individuals from your home country that attend school here as well that you have shared experiences with. One of my good friends is from China and she seems to know Chinese individuals in every department of the school and has done lunar new year and travel over breaks with them  But generally speaking like other have suggested if you get involved and engaged with your dorm or clubs, you‚Äôll meet all types of people
comment,Prospective Student,positive,an international/resident community that‚Äôs cool to check out is truth coop from www.icc.coop! the house is like 50/50 so it‚Äôs a fun atmosphere with a variety of perspectives
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As many have said, there are plenty of international communities that you can join to make friends quickly.  There is some  value in making friendships based on what dirt you were born on. However, it's probably to your benefit to expand your friend group beyond that island of your compatriots.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It depends on the social skills of the international student. If the international student has good social skills it will be very easy to make friends. If the international student has poor social skills, it will likely be a lot more difficult.
post,Prospective Student,neutral,Hi! I'm a senior in High School at the moment, and I'm committing to U of M for Engineering! So I've been reading about Michigan Engineering being a GPA killer, specifically the required course Physics 240. I was wondering if there are any ways to skip this class other than getting a 5 on the AP Phys E/M test. I didn't take AP Phys C this year because I am planning to major in Chemical Engineering. Are there any summer classes that are offered or community college courses that would give me credit to skip Physics 240? Thanks!!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The best way to check this is to look at U of M's credit equivalency chart: https://apps.engin.umich.edu/equivalencies/  That being said, I don't think getting a good grade in 240 is impossible. If you attend lecture, do the hw, and join a good SLC group you should be good
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Consider taking it at a nearby community college. If you take "Analytical Physics" I & II at WCC those should transfer to meet the requirement.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you go to [this link](https://apps.engin.umich.edu/equivalencies/courses/equivalentto/physics/240?max=50&sort=umCourse&order=desc&offset=150) it should give you a list of schools that have courses that will fulfill that credit.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you wanted to move to campus early, or take physics 240 summer after freshman year, Washtenaw Community college is a great place to take it. It's a ~10-15 minute drive from campus. Much easier than UMich 240, and cheaper too.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If I could go through college again and change stuff. This is what I‚Äôd change. I‚Äôd take all my calc and physics at a community college to save money and preserve my mental health. These classes are horrible at Michigan but once you get through them everyone else is way better.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Take physics 260/261 instead.  It is a lot of daily work, but you learn the material very well and the lab is taught by the head GSI that trains all of the GSIs for 240.  We had to take all of the 240 exams and I believe the average was roughly 90% on each. The lab class was very helpful in understanding the concepts.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,240 is a lot easier than people make it seem. You just go to lecture, do the flip it physics questions, read uncovered lecture slides, and do all the practice quizzes and requiz yourself on questions you missed. You‚Äôll be good to go on the quizzes and the final
comment,Prospective Student,negative,It‚Äôs really not that bad and it‚Äôs part of the experience. You could also take it at a community college, but you can‚Äôt just skip it.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Is your concern learning the material or paying for it (& ur time)? There‚Äôs ChemE classes near the end that get really close to 240 content. I‚Äôd just wait as long as you physically can and then just rip off tha bandaids
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Michigan State used to have an online version that could be taken over the summer. Not sure if it's still available. Very manageable
comment,Prospective Student,negative,I was a chemE major until junior year and ended up taking physics 240 my senior year.  By that point I had taken thermo and fluids as a chemE and I found that physics 240 was much more manageable in comparison. Ymmv but imo the class isn't as bad as it's made out to be, and if you stick with chemE you'll be fine waiting to take it. Of course, you may want to get 240 out of the way early just in case you don't want to stick with chemE (I didn't)
comment,Prospective Student,negative,i think the average grade in physics 240 is a b, which isn't necessarily a gpa killer. try to take it at a community college. but if you can't, it will be okay. if you have to take math 115/116/215/216, those classes also round their average to a b. i wouldn't expect to get all A's here, however i do agree that a lot of these required courses in COE are beyond difficult and have irritating grading scales. try to get some classes done at a community college, make sure the credits will transfer over though.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,No matter what, it would come down to an advisor, they have a crazy amount of power. They could OK other community college physics classes or other 'equivalent' classes. (I was practically gifted credit for calc 2 by an advisor that wasn't covered by APs, solely because I passed calc 3)  A specific class to look into could be getting credit for Physics 260, the honors version of 240. It's a way smaller sized class that's less intent on destroying students. In my opinion, it's way easier and more relevant.  It shooould transfer for ChemE (I nearly switched over to that major and the fact that I took honors instead of regular didn't immediately blow up in my face.)   But again, in my experience, an advisors word is pretty much law, so make sure to chat with some of them, they can hook you up big time.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm currently attending Schoolcraft college finishing up my MTA (Michigan Transfer Agreement) and am aspiring to transfer into the school of information. I'm looking for advice on whether I should find an associate's to finish or simply finish MTA and apply to Umich SoI. Would having an associate's have any advantages? Thank you for any help, this subreddit is full of incredible information and helpful people!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You might be eligible to earn an associate degree at Schoolcraft with UofM credits via their reverse transfer agreement. Ask your academic advisors for more info on this.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I finished my associate's at Jackson College and then transferred to UM for my junior/senior years. Having an associate's also allows you to transfer 62 credits instead of the normal 60, and you can use your old institution as an opportunity to knock out any pre-req classes.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Umich doesn't formally accept the MTA, that said, it will still accept just about all of the credits in the MTA. The associates gives you the chance to transfer up to 62 credit hours instead of 60, but that's about it.   Biggest thing I can recommend is to check all of the classes that you intend on transferring, and take any prerequisites you may be missing.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The quantity of credits is the only Potential value (so paying less for credits at a cc then at Michigan). There‚Äôs no huge benefit for finishing the associates
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,What is the overall consensus on studying abroad through UMich?? Is it cheaper than regular out-of-state tuition? Is it easy to find programs that apply to your major and areas of interest?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Yes there‚Äôs so many different programs that cover a wide variety of interests, no it‚Äôs not cheaper. The program I did was through U of M specifically so the program tuition was just regular in state and out of state prices
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I studied abroad for wayyyyyyy cheaper than regular tuition. LSA gives out study abroad scholarships of up to $10,000. Combine that with other scholarships (e.g. many study abroad programs will have specific program scholarships you can apply to), and you can end up with a semester almost for free. In my case, I studied abroad in Denmark on the DIS program, and I paid $0 that semester due to 10k LSA scholarship and 10k DIS scholarship. I strongly urge everyone in college to study abroad if it fits in your schedule. It's a life changing experience, and as long as you do your research and due diligence, you can find programs that match your interest and enroll in them for cheaper than a regular semester at umich.
post,Housing,positive,Hi! So I got admitted to LSA for Psychology, and I wanted to know: what housing is the best for LSA students? How's the housing in UM in general? Like what are the best and worst residential halls? I heard that in addition to South and East Quad, North Quad is good too, but there's a stigma around North campus? I honestly don't know much about the housing, I was researching about it but I'm not so well versed with it.   Thanks!
comment,Housing,positive,You don‚Äôt get to choose your specific dorm as a freshman. Almost all of the rooms for freshmen are doubles with shared hall bathrooms. Most corridors are single sex, but some are co-ed (if they‚Äôre co-ed, the bathrooms are still single sex). All but two small buildings (only women live in Newberry-Barbour and Martha Cook, the latter requiring a special application) are co-ed.  North Quad is not on North Campus. But it also does not house freshmen.   If you join LSA Honors, they have an optional residential program with housing in South Quad.   If the themes interest you, joining a Michigan Learning Community (MLC) is a way to guarantee a spot in a specific dorm. All but one MLC is located on Central Campus.
comment,Housing,negative,North campus has the worst housing (but it‚Äôs really not bad) and you have to take a bus ride (~10 mins) to class and back every day. That‚Äôs the only problem with north campus. You don‚Äôt get to choose but north campus isn‚Äôt as bad as people make it out to be. You also bond with a lot of people over living together up there
comment,Housing,positive,Don‚Äôt worry about housing. I ended up in Markley, which is often viewed as the worst on central and still had a good time. Honestly, I think the worse the dorm, the closer you get to bond with the kids in your halls, and I think making closer friendships is much more important than AC and nice bathrooms.
comment,Housing,positive,When I was signing up for housing a couple years ago I at least was asked for preference as to what style of dorm I wanted and the order of campuses I would want to live on. And I was put on Hill Campus in Oxford which sounded bad at the time but I ended up loving it so you really cant go bad with dorms. However, if in LSA, most of your classes will be on central so central campus or hill would probably be best but if you like a more quieter environment and wouldnt mind the commute, North Campus is also good. Also central campus is a lot closer to downtown Ann Arbor so if you want to be near more restaurants and shops, central and hill would be best
comment,Housing,negative,Do not end up on north campus. It is as bad as people say.  Otherwise you‚Äôll be fine.  t. Lived in bursley
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi, I‚Äôm majoring in music, and I want to learn more about writing, arranging and producing music in jazz, classical, pop, and many other genres. I‚Äôm interested in improving my technology skills, and I also want to learn the business side of things as I enter the industry.  i have the option of going to UCLA for the History and Industry program or UMICH for Preforming Arts Technology. Right now the music tech program at UMICH seems to suit my goals better, but does anyone have any helpful suggestions or experiences?
post,Degree,positive,I got rejected from BSI cross-campus transfer last night lol :( so I was just wondering if anyone has any recommendations for similar paths within LSA? (Majors, Minors, Major/Mino combos that would be doable as I am now a second semester sophomore?) Right now I am looking at either Stats or CogSci (I have CogSci prereqs and almost all stats prereqs) and possible minors but would love to hear other suggestions.
comment,Degree,positive,Cog-sci is the best choice since you can take SI classes for electives for some tracks I think.
comment,Degree,positive,Check out the Digital Studies Institute and the STS minor! I think a STS major might also be on the way.  Best of luck for the future! your worth doesn't depend on a rejection.
comment,Degree,positive,if you are really set on SI, you could continue to take SI classes and apply again next year, and by then I think they will see how dedicated you are to the program. Unless you don't want to go, then try informatics. the only track left in informatics is "life sciences informatics" though, which has a mix of biology, computer science, and statistics classes. the prerequisites are SI 110, STATS 250, MATH 115, and EECS 183 (or equivalent).
comment,Degree,positive,This new department might interest you, [QMSS](https://lsa.umich.edu/qmss)
comment,Degree,positive,Not a full program, but the Multidisciplinary Minor can be very useful in gaining UX/UI skills.   It's whatever you make of it. They have many different projects that can either be research, corporate-sponsored, and student org driven.    Penny Stamps offers electives to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Acrobat.  If you don't mind being more quantitative,  Stats or IOE majors are good. Stats can obviously be very data-driven and IOE can delve in human-centered design principles.
post,Satellite Campus,positive,Does anyone know how the biochem and biological sciences bachelors is like in umich Dearborn? If it‚Äôs good? Goal is medicine
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,I have a friend doing biochemistry at umd, I'm not sure if that's the same thing as biological sciences. The experience/program seems to be what you make of it. Small classrooms/department so you can really get to know professors.  Idk how hard it is to get research opportunities but I think it's a good step towards graduate schools; I've met a few grad students here who did their undergrad at Dearborn/Wayne State if that helps.  Though this subreddit is almost entirely AA campus students, so you might have better luck in r/dearbornwolverines, although it is not super active unfortunately

post,COVID-19,positive,does anyone know the schedule/how often they give out vaccines at the big house? has anyone ever heard of them giving out extras?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,[I used this site to schedule an appointment and received my first Pfizer shot at a Riteaid about an hour away from A2.](https://www.findashot.org/appointments/us/MI)
comment,COVID-19,neutral,They‚Äôre not doing many now because most of the doses are going to local health departments. I think they‚Äôve only done 8,000 in the past two weeks. Which is way down from the 20,000 a week they were doing in January and February.
comment,COVID-19,positive,i honestly would check out rite aid, meijer, ford field, or go through the washtenaw county site. U of M is way behind their vaccine schedule (email yesterday says they‚Äôre still working on vaccinating people 50+ y/o with underlying  conditions. best way to get a vax at u of m if you‚Äôre under 50 is if you volunteer.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Most of the shots in the county are now happening at the convention center in Ypsilanti.   See here for more info: [https://www.washtenaw.org/3337/Where-to-Get-the-COVID-19-Vaccine](https://www.washtenaw.org/3337/Where-to-Get-the-COVID-19-Vaccine)
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Michigan Medicine is in charge of this vaccination site. If you are an existing patient or have registered for Blue Queue as described here https://mmheadlines.org/2020/11/covid-19-vaccination-planning-faqs/ you‚Äôll be on the list to get a vaccine appointment there. But keep in mind that other locations, including drug store and supermarket pharmacies, may be able to offer you an appointment sooner.   Here‚Äôs their info page, with links to FAQs, etc.: https://www.uofmhealth.org/coronavirus/vaccine-info-update  Edited to add: here‚Äôs an excerpt from one of the FAQs I found (source: https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/vaccine/#does-m-mdispose-leftover-vaccine-header)  Q: I heard that Michigan Medicine is disposing of leftover vaccinations at the end of the day, is that true?  A: No. Michigan Medicine administers 100% of the doses they receive. If appointments are missed, and it appears doses will be available that need to be used by the end of the day, Michigan Medicine draws from a standing waitlist of people who have already received a vaccination invitation. Michigan Medicine also has vaccinated staff and volunteers at the vaccination clinic to ensure no doses are wasted.
comment,COVID-19,positive,April 5, vaccination opens to all Michigan adults. Probably less effort to just wait until the fifth.   Supposedly there‚Äôs a glut of vaccines coming. Should be easy to get an appointment in April.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Ohio is giving vaccines out regardless of age and residency I‚Äôve had a dozen friends at this point drive down to Toledo or other spots in Ohio for their shot. Rite aid is doing daily walk in clinics
comment,COVID-19,positive,FWIW:  both my spouse and I are non-essential UM employees and also patients in their system.  I‚Äôm a category ahead of him due to a medical condition.  I was offered an appointment from UM for a week ago‚Äîbut not at the Big House; it was in Ypsi and done in partnership with the health dept. I turned it down because I had just booked one with Meijer.   Seven days later my spouse got the UM call, and was offered an appt for yesterday, at the Big House.  I interpreted this sequence of events to mean that they are perhaps  just starting to get sufficient supply to ramp up big house vaccinations for ordinary people (affiliated with UM in some way).    Haven‚Äôt heard about extras.  I also get the impression that people in Ann Arbor are pretty good about keeping their appointments, so I think sites in Ann Arbor maybe less likely to have leftover shots than in other areas.  Just a gut feeling.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Plenty of places should possibly have extras at the end of the day, you can try calling them and see
comment,COVID-19,neutral,check out [HiDrB.com](https://HiDrB.com) for standby lists in the area
comment,COVID-19,neutral,If you can, try to get an appointment at Ford field. I was able to get my vaccine yesterday!
comment,COVID-19,positive,While it probably doesn't help you today, state of Michigan is going to 16+ year olds on April 5.
comment,COVID-19,positive,u/Complementary5169's post has all the links I was going to share, however if I were you I would not rely on Michigan Medicine at this point. This might be a really savage take, but they're embarrassingly behind on their vaccine rollout (the last I checked the website it said they're like 2 expansions behind; a week from today is when widespread eligibility is supposed to begin and they're just now getting to 50+ age groups). I know they're blaming the state, but other health systems in the state are more confidently scheduling appointments. The skeptic in me suspects that something is going on internally that they aren't sharing with the public.   If you want additional places to check, I recommend joining the [Detroit Vaccine Hunter](https://www.facebook.com/groups/225542865902649) Facebook group. Tons of resources and tips being shared there! Several people have also offered rides and carpools to those who need transportation assistance.

post,Prospective Student,neutral,Planning a visit with my daughter in April. She‚Äôs been admitted and still undecided. I realize there  are no tours at this time.  Any recommendations of what to see ?   Maybe someone who can show us around informally ?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I would go to the central campus diag. And just explore the campus buildings, see the groups of people around. Also, if she's engineering, art, or music go visit the grove on north campus. Both of those places are essentially the center and will show all the buildings and a large amount of the active students. State street is also a nice little area of restaurants and stores just off the diag.  Without an actual tour and due to covid I imagine it will be hard to enter many buildings. However you can see and identify them from the outside.   I believe both the central campus diagonal and the north campus grove will show up on google maps.   You will be able to use the umich busses to get around for free, though that won't really be needed apart from going from north to central and back. Use the umich magic bus app to see the routes.  What drew me here was the large amount of small locally owned restaurants and the architecture of the campus.    P.S. check out of FAT squirrels on the central campus diag, they're really friendly and some of them will walk up and take food out of your hand if you offer it to them.

post,New Student,positive,Does anyone know how the masters program works for Computer Engineering? Also, is it worth it?
comment,New Student,positive,https://masters.engin.umich.edu/degree/electrical-computer-engineering-mse/ It's 1-2 years with optional thesis. Here is salary info from the university https://career.engin.umich.edu/career/salary-info/ Take a look at past years to get a better idea of average salaries.  I would speak with an advisor about the advantages about doing a master's. Advantages include a potential faster career progression and a higher average salary. Your resume would be more attractive. Significantly less people have a master's degree than a bachelor's.  Disadvantages include 1-2 years of additional school and having to come up with  ~$30,000. You also lose out on 1-2 years of working. Could look into being a GSI/GSRA to pay for the tuition.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello! I was recently waitlisted at UMich and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get off the waitlist? I'm planning on sending a LOCI to my regional AO, but any advice would be great :) Thank you!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You pretty much just wait and hope people withdraw their acceptance/go elsewhere. I was waitlisted on 3/31 and got off the waitlist on 5/6, 2017. Don‚Äôt think a LOCI would help as much as it does in a deferral (if at all)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Last year I was waitlisted on March 31 and I got off the waitlist on April 23 (for CoE).  If I remember correctly I was hesitant to send a LOCI because on UMich's website they say they "do not accept an additional documents" and I honestly can't remember if I sent one or not. That being said, I would send it because it'll either do nothing or help you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I don‚Äôt know if a LOCI will really help. I applied early action last year and got deferred and they gave me an area where I could submit a letter of continued interest. I got waitlisted in March and then got in April (around the end of the month). It‚Äôs going to be hard but u just got to wait it out.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Just wait and hope! I know it sounds frustrating but it‚Äôs really all you can do. I misread my first decision and thought I was denied and was shocked when I get let off the waitlist almost 45 days later!
comment,Prospective Student,negative,I was also waitlisted, does anyone know if UMICH waitlists all rejected applicants?I heard it is something they‚Äôre doing specifically this year but I‚Äôm not sure.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I‚Äôm not sure if a LOCI would help but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try. I didn‚Äôt send one in last year cause they explicitly said not to and I got off the waitlist 23 days after my waitlist decision.
post,New Student,positive,I just got accepted to U of M and I‚Äôm super excited but I‚Äôm a little worried of the academic transition. So this year, I‚Äôve barely learned anything due to online classes and at this point I‚Äôm just self studying. I‚Äôm a premed so how hard are freshman weeder courses if you don‚Äôt have a strong grade 12 base. I‚Äôm from Canada so I‚Äôm not an AP or IB student.
comment,New Student,positive,Freshman year (and even afterwards) is basically teaching yourself how to actually study. Especially with prehealth prerequisites they will try and weed out whoever they can (it‚Äôs unfortunate, but it‚Äôs the truth of the matter). Looking over your notes like you may have 10 minutes before an exam in HS or just winging it completely won‚Äôt get you far. You really need to know how to apply the information they give you in addition to memorization. Building a solid foundation your first year and figuring out what works for you (because everybody learns differently) is absolutely crucial for your academic success and it will serve you well the rest of your college career. It may take a bit of trial and error but better but you‚Äôll get the hang of it. Good luck!
comment,New Student,negative,I'm a Canadian who did IB and an Alberta diploma. Which part of Canada are you from? If you're from Ontario and went to a standard public school where there's a lot of grade inflation, I feel it could be more difficult than expected. However, that's not necessarily a given and it's dependent on you and your study habits.
comment,New Student,neutral,I also came from a very small school with 2 AP classes offered. It was hard going from the very top of my class to not even close to the top, there are some insanely smart kids at UM that make everyone feel bad, but don‚Äôt get discouraged by them. I would also suggest going to office hours. I also thought that college would be crazy hard, but it‚Äôs not. Getting an A in every class is absolutely possible if you study and put the work in. Finding people in your classes to study with and check ideas with is huge. You can also join official science learning center groups which are extremely helpful. Math at UM in general is very difficult, but you can also spend a lot of time in the math lab getting things explained to you by numerous people.
comment,New Student,positive,Old tests is without a doubt the best way to study for exams. Easiest way to find them is to make older friends that have theirs lying around. Also a lot of fraternities have test banks and you can also find them on course hero.

comment,News,negative,He is not going to resign or be forced out. There is too much money involved.
comment,News,negative,Deeply disappointing that someone on the board would make 'quips' like that.     I'm embarrassed he represents the U.  Calling the opposing party "witches" feels like he sanitized his opinion with a single letter.  And it doesn't sound like he represents a point-of-view of challenging others ideas, but rather demonizing people that disagree.      It feels like it would be difficult to work with him.  He \_should\_ resign.  At least, I hope he is not re-elected.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I have looked around the subreddit for information regarding this topic, I have found answers to a couple of my questions but there are still a few that I am unsure about. I plan on attending MSU but then transferring to CoE at Umich, MechE at both, I was just wondering how soon I can apply for a transfer and be successful at Umich, I see that it‚Äôs recommended after sophomore year but some have had success after freshman. My last question is what gpa do I need to maintain to transfer to CoE?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The application deadline is going to be the beginning of the 2nd semester of your freshman year. You‚Äôll have the option to apply for the summer semester or the fall semester. To transfer as a freshman applicant into the CoE, you‚Äôll need as close to a 4.0 as you can get. Umich prefers sophomore applicants so naturally it‚Äôs much easier to get in as a sophomore. For example, I had a 3.67 and got into LSA as a sophomore applicant and one of my friends had a 3.5 and got into CoE as a sophomore applicant (I should note that both of us had 3.9+ GPA for our majors and were taking graduate level courses in math). Umich is very holistic so keep that into account. Good luck.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I transferred in to MechE my sophomore year (applied to transfer as a freshman with only one semester of credits finished at my previous university, got accepted, started fall of my sophomore year). I'm pretty sure the GPA cut-off is around a 3.5, but what the transfer admissions team is really looking for is whether you've taken the engineering [pre-requisite classes](https://www.engin.umich.edu/admissions/undergrad/transfer-students/admissions/). When you fill out the application, they want to see that you've either already taken all the classes listed, have AP credit for them, or have a plan to take them by the time you start classes at UofM. They're pretty strict about this too, you can't just plan to wait to start at UofM to take physics, for example. It can get you out of Michigan Math though, which will be a major win for your mental health.  It'll take you at least five semesters (and doing it in five is super tough, the advisors will push you to take six) at UofM to graduate once you transfer in because of the way the course sequence is laid out, so transferring in after freshman year is a good idea if you want to save money. Going to MSU will probably give you an advantage in applying to transfer over say a community college, because it's stronger evidence that you can handle the big university experience, so I think you could definitely pull it off with a good GPA and completed pre-reqs.  Feel free to DM me if you have any more questions
post,Finances,positive,I plan on taking 9 credits at Washtenaw CC, which is like $1000 without financial aid. I am confused about how financial aid applies to summer classes or if you can even get financial aid for summer classes. If anyone has any insight they can share, I would appreciate it.
comment,Finances,positive,Contact the financial aid office at Washtenaw Community College. The phone number is 734-973-3523. The email address is finaid@wccnet.edu.   Good luck!
comment,Finances,positive,Coming from the other perspective, I took classes at UM over the spring when I was still at Washtenaw, and UM wanted me to have WCC send them my financial aid information. So maybe it's possible you'll get something in terms of money? Not entirely sure how it all works tho.
comment,Finances,negative,UM isn‚Äôt going to give you money for classes at a different school. And they generally don‚Äôt give financial aid for summer classes, or it‚Äôs much more limited. As a community college, don‚Äôt expect any aid from Washtenaw either.
comment,Finances,positive,You‚Äôre financial aid (FASFA) probably won‚Äôt apply. Usually the FASFA only covers 2 full time semesters an academic year, and then if you do want to try to get summer aid, your institution has to do some distribution stuff for you to try to get it. So WCC may not be able to do that, especially if you‚Äôre not full time for the summer semester  But your best bet is to talk to their financial aid office directly
post,Housing,neutral,What options are available for singles/doubles for a returning Junior?
comment,Housing,neutral,I assume you mean going back to the dorms? If so, housing is usually distributed in reverse seniority (Freshmen first, Seniors Last.)  So if you get housing as an upperclassman, it's most likely in Northwood. Most upperclassmen I knew that got housing were RAs.
comment,Housing,neutral,Check out the housing coops! [icc.coop](https://icc.coop)
post,Degree,positive,I was wondering if after I finish my required 15 credits of Upper Level Electives for EE, would I be able to take future Upper Level Electives as P/F? I want to take some extra courses since I have room in my schedule but don't want to worry about grades or affecting my GPA if I don't enjoy or don't do well. Is this how P/F works for classes taken after the degree requirements are completed?
comment,Degree,positive,Yes.
post,Housing,positive,Hi, junior-transfer student here.  I'm a predicament regarding my living options for the next school year. My parents and I live in the Ann Arbor-Ypsi area and I was wondering if it is worth it to live off campus (in an apartment/house) very close to downtown or just stay living with my parents.  Basically, I'm asking if there are any differences being minutes walks away from all the campus activities, living alone versus just buying a parking pass and driving to campus and enjoying uofm that way.  Answers from people that live distant from campus (needing a car) would be very useful.  Thanks for any input!
comment,Housing,positive,Financially, best decision is to live with parents hands down.   However, keep in mind that living in the dorms or co-ops is something you will almost never be able to replicate in your later adult life. This exposes you to a lot of different people to form many close-tight friendships and social circles in a short amount of time.   Living alone -- you will have plenty of opportunities to do that as a working professional. Although it doesn't make sense financially or socially, if it allows you to focus more academically, it could be worth it if you want a jumpstart on independence.
post,Class,positive,I applied for a late drop Saturday last week. I received the confirmation email telling me that the process will take several days to complete, but all action will be taken on the day of the request and to track the status of the request.  It's been nearly a week now and I've gotten nothing. I've checked the status of the request every day and all it says is that it's waiting for a level 2 approval. Should I send an email to the advising center? Does the process normally take this long?
comment,Class,negative,Same thing happened to me, so I emailed my advisor. The professor has to approve of it first before the advisor can send it through, but if the professor doesn't approve it/lost it in their mail, your advisor can just execute an electronic override.

comment,Degree,positive,They usually like if you are related to a snake. Anacondas and pythons have the highest acceptance rate, but rattlesnakes have faced discrimination in the past. Even if you aren‚Äôt a snake, I‚Äôve heard of people getting snakeskin from a snake friend and putting it in their application envelope to try to fake it
comment,Degree,neutral,You‚Äôre not gonna get a serious answer here
comment,Degree,positive,I‚Äôm not too knowledgeable but I‚Äôve heard the essays are important. I‚Äôm a Ross major so our process is different but I know my essays were probably the main reason I got in
comment,Degree,positive,Ross likes it when you take initiative and lead around campus. If you have any leadership roles, try to talk about it and the impact you made on others. I ended up not applying because my graduation plans changed, but definitely work hard on the essays- In my opinion, they're important.
comment,Degree,positive,The essays are really important. I think they‚Äôre really looking for how business can add to/integrate with your major so definitely put a lot of effort into that essay.  Also, it‚Äôs huge to show how you plan to make an impact with your degree aspirations. It also helps to have a strong gpa but that‚Äôs not everything of course.  Make sure your resume is up to date with all your leadership and extracurricular experiences too. (But it‚Äôs not any different from resume when applying to a job.)  Edit for context: I‚Äôm in the Ross minor and this is what I gather from friends in the minor as well as friends in Ross.
post,New Student,positive,currently a freshman who unfortunately did not enjoy her college experience. i spent my first semester in the dorms with a less than ideal roommate and a small amount of friends. my social experience wasn't the best and the entire time i was wishing to go back home or transfer schools. the only reason i didn't apply as a spring transfer elsewhere was because i was advised to give it another semester. unfortunately, since umich kicked freshmen out of the dorms i've spent the winter semester at home, while the majority of my peers got apartments or houses on campus. i tried joining greek life and eventually dropped virtual rush bc it was impossible to be in a sorority from home and i don't really have any options for fall housing besides my first semester roommate and the last thing i want to do is live in the dorms or by myself. i applied to other schools, but i honestly don't know what to do about coming back in the fall since i'm not sure if i should let go of michigan so soon or if all of this has been a sign to transfer. pls help!
comment,New Student,positive,It really depends on why you're going to school. Do you want the Umich degree, or do you care more about "the college experience?" How can you be certain that the social life at CMU, Western, EMU, etc. will be more accepting / lively during the pandemic?  These are just questions to help guide your thinking. Ultimately you should make the best decision for yourself, and do what you need to.
comment,New Student,positive,Transferring does not seem like the move. Quite frankly I don‚Äôt know what you think would‚Äôve been better had you been at a different school. Hardly anyone at any school had a meaningful in-person experience this year.
comment,New Student,positive,Take the summer off and give it another chance in the fall semester. This year has been fucking weird and not at all representative of what the university is normally like. It'll be better once the vaccine has been deployed more and we can have in-person classes.
comment,New Student,positive,If housing has been an issue and you don‚Äôt want to live alone, you could consider the co-ops here in Ann Arbor. I can‚Äôt speak too much on it since I haven‚Äôt lived in one, but I think it could be worth looking into for your situation. My impression is that they offer affordable housing and it tends to be pretty communal and close knit because everyone that lives in the house divides up the chores and responsibilities, so you wouldn‚Äôt be alone.   This semester definitely hasn‚Äôt been representative of a normal year at Michigan, so I hope this is something you can keep in mind as you decide whether you want to transfer or not. As others have mentioned, if most of your issues stem from online schooling and lack of an in-person social life, I would definitely recommend holding out for an in-person semester before making your judgment call too quickly!
comment,New Student,positive,I probably won't say anything new but I don't think you should transfer. Especially for freshmen, this year has been very rough. Not much social stuff, very isolated, increased course load, etc. But it's not always like this!!! I'm sure people have said that already but it's true. I have pretty high hopes for next year so I think you should stay. Umich is honestly a great place, even though this year it might not have seemed like it :/  As for housing, try co-ops. I've heard nothing but positive reviews from friends  Good luck!
comment,New Student,neutral,I can't imagine any school being a good experience this year lol. Fall will probably still be weird. It's just a bad time to go to college.
comment,New Student,negative,First of all, the best roommates I‚Äôve had were random people that I got apartments with either completely randomly or off Facebook getting subleases. Second of all, I‚Äôve been to MSU and transferred to umich and the college experience it not any different there. This year sucks so I understand you‚Äôre disappointed but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs happening at every university. If you hate it here so much and need to go elsewhere that‚Äôs fine but if I was you I‚Äôd try to forget this year and try to start over next year when you have a chance at a real college experience. I know that‚Äôs hard but that‚Äôs what every freshman will need to do
comment,New Student,positive,FWIW, as a freshman in normal times I fucking hated my college experience as well.  I tried clubs, tried to make friends, talked in class, and ultimately made little enough progress that I went home every chance I got.  Things got so much better, though.  By semester sophomore year I was going to the gym regularly as a hobby, made a few ‚Äî not many ‚Äî friends I really clicked with, and followed that up with a Junior and Senior year that I wish never ended.  YMMV, but getting into the rhythm of things can take time.  I don‚Äôt think transferring will help you as it‚Äôll just be the same old problems in a new place.
comment,New Student,positive,I believe the transfer application deadline for most schools has already passed. So your choices at this point are basically to stay at umich or take a semester off and then transfer. I agree with previous commenters that given that your issues seem to stem with college being online, transferring to any other place that would be primarily online, you‚Äôd have the same issues but without knowing even a single person. If umich is primarily in person in the fall, you‚Äôll probably want to give that a try and then decide if you want to transfer. I will say, I have found off campus fall housing as late as April with people I only kind of knew at the time. Facebook housing groups always have people looking for another roommate. Hooking on with random people doesn‚Äôt necessarily always work out, but for me it was a good arrangement and I ended up loving with them again this year. You may want to try that.
comment,New Student,positive,Feel free to send me your social media handles and I can pass them on to my friend who is looking for a roommate next semester. She's super cool and she similarly dropped virtual rush. She wants to live in the dorms but doesn't have a roommate. I met her last semester in Markley and she would be an awesome roommate
comment,New Student,positive,Hey, rarely go on Reddit anymore but I was scrolling through and came across this post. Just wanted to say that I absolutely hated my freshman year. I went home just about every weekend because I couldn‚Äôt stand my dorm and I had basically no friends except for a couple kids I went to high school with. Got really depressed and considered dropping out. Still managed to do well in my classes because studying was basically all I did since I had no social life. I stuck with it, though. Soph year I got a house with 2 friends. Still didn‚Äôt have much of a social life, but it was nice being out of the dorms I guess. Now, I‚Äôm a junior and I finally have a good group of friends that I hang out with a lot and I‚Äôm actually enjoying my college experience. Freshman year, I despised the weekends because I knew it meant everyone would be going out and having fun while I was cooped up in my dorm room. Now, I look forward to the weekends and for chances to hang out with friends and socialize.   Just wanted to let you know that it can get better. I promise you that you aren‚Äôt the only one who feels alone and sort of lost. Don‚Äôt forget to work on yourself, too.
comment,New Student,positive,Reading through all of these responses and I don't understand why everyone is saying to "give it another chance". Look, I'm going into my senior year next year and I have been considering transferring almost every semester I have been here. I have been able to make incredible friends, but I do not think the strain this place has put on my mental health has been worth it and many times (especially now) I wish I went to somewhere, maybe anywhere, else.   The way this school has reacted during the pandemic is appalling- all of my friends at other schools have better experiences. Michigan two semesters in a row promised some form of hybrid classes and both semesters I had no classes in person at all. I don't want to be negative/pessimistic- but Michigan could VERY much do this for fall semester. They know people will pay for this degree and they can kind of do whatever they want because of this.  Michigan is a huge school, and it is very easy to get lost here. I have struggled with joining clubs/finding communities because although I want to be involved with those activities I am constantly overwhelmed with school and basically doing work all the time instead of branching out (I am an EECS major, to be fair lol). Yes, Michigan is a 'great degree' and blah blah blah- I worked at Microsoft last summer with students at Penn State, UMass Amherst, and many community colleges. Degrees are not that important, what's important is your mental health and happiness. This whole idea that you should "rough it out" for another semester is bullshit, I've been doing that the whole time I've been here and now it's really too late for me to transfer anywhere else. If you go somewhere that you feel you will be able to balance academics/social life and hobbies, you are going to be way better off than being miserable for a "top-tier degree". I completely disagree with anyone in these comments that say its worth it. Prioritize your well being. If you don't feel like this is the place for you, go somewhere else. You will be so much better off as a healthy graduate than an extremely burnt out and mental worn down graduate.  Take it from someone who is exhausted from the competitive climate of this school. Academics are important-but lets be real. The past year of school has been a complete shit show-either classes are painfully easy or impossibly difficult for no reason. My opinion of a Michigan degree has diminished. Life is short, college should be an experience where you are challenged and grow, not watch your mental health disintegrate despite your best efforts. Prioritize your health so you can work hard and you will be way better off than with a more prestigious degree.
comment,New Student,neutral,This is a really tough year, honestly. I'm a first year masters student at Umich and of all my years in college... including the semester I was at CMU after high school that I failed out of because of depression, and a semester of classes I did online a year after that... this has been the hardest one I've ever had.  I'm disinterested in my classes, and I am finding it so hard to motivate myself to do any school work... I'm procrastinating some things right now even..  I think its a hard decision to make. I'm all for promoting community college after high school and then transferring to a 4-year...it's what I did once I finally got back to school 3 years after high school, so that‚Äôs generally where my bias is. However, you gotta do whats right for you.   I'm skeptical whether the fall will be online or in-person. I know they day it'll all be in person but im still unsure. If it is in person, my advice really would be to try another semester because classes in person is SO different than with everything remote. I can't even imagine being a freshmen right now. Usually its in class or in clubs or during events that you meet other people but the only exposure you've had has been to your roommate and that just isn't normally what happens.  I also wouldn't write off staying in the dorms again *especially* if it's in person. It can be a weight off your shoulders as far as responsibility goes... but if you have the ability to be in an apartment, ans prefer that. look around for subleases or people who need another roommate and meet someone new that way. It doesn't always work out but it can!  But if its online again...or if you really don't think you can do another semester at UMich, then take a semester off or do a semester at a community College where your credits can transfer or something.   The only thing that I would really advise against is just transferring to a different university because I get the feeling that the issues you're experiencing have nothing to do with Umich and everything to do with the pandemic response, and transferring to another university is not going to fix that.
comment,New Student,positive,You just gotta stick it out another year. This place is way better without covid.
comment,New Student,positive,hey im also a freshman and i had a lot of similar thoughts. i was on campus first sem and being at home this sem has rlly made me consider transferring.   the thing that rlly changed my mind was talking with friends from highschool since a lot of them had pretty bad experiences. i talked with ppl from nyu and some other nearby schools and they honestly probably had a worst first sem than i did. even the friends that partied and rushed didnt enjoy the experience much. virtual rushing seems totally impossible.  imo if your gut feeling from first semester is to transfer then id consider it . you mentioned that you‚Äôve already applied so if that works out then its not a bad option. id try to ignore this semester tho since college from home anywhere makes we want to tear my eyes out haha.   good luck with whatever you decide and honestly you seem like the kind of person who will figure it out either way. im totally down to talk more if you want though since its a rlly tough decision. also lmk if u decide to stay since i gotta make more friends. been a weird year :)
comment,New Student,positive,I'm not sure I can add to some already great advice by others, but want to say I'm proud of you for reaching out and seeking help from others on the matter. I hope regardless of your decision that you find the things that make you happy and wish you the best in the rest of your college career.
comment,New Student,positive,Adjusting to college life is a huge adjustment for everyone, including students who seemingly have it together. NYU works for a very self assured person who can take advantage of the incredible networking opportunities it offers. People are giving great advice on how things turned around for them following freshman year. Your health is the most important thing,, but think seriously about what it means to leave and then potentially regret doing this for many years to come.
comment,New Student,positive,I‚Äôm not sure why you think housing is such an issue. You can just rent a room in a house with other undergrads you find on Craigslist or Facebook groups. It‚Äôs super easy and a great way to meet new people.   It‚Äôs worrying that you didn‚Äôt mention academics at all. If you want the college experience you can get it at UM after covid. Don‚Äôt lose this opportunity to get a great degree.
comment,New Student,positive,Very little of what you're describing is Michigan stuff, it's mostly COVID stuff. Hardly any of it will be improved by transferring
comment,New Student,positive,For this fall you can try living in a co op. They‚Äôre cheaper than rent, it‚Äôs easy to do it for only one semester, and people usually make good friends with their co op roommates. On the other hand if you transfer you might be able to get into a higher ranked school. It‚Äôs really up to you, but it‚Äôs totally possibly once we get back to in person to have a fun social experience on campus. Good luck :)
comment,New Student,positive,I was in a similar situation during undergrad (although not at UM).  I absolutely hated my freshman year, I was lonely and homesick all the time, I didn't make many friends, and I applied to transfer to a university in my home state.  I didn't and it got better slowly.  I met people in my major once I got through the big freshmen classes, and campus started feeling more familiar and less lonely.  I'm really glad I didn't transfer, because I would have felt the exact same way at the new university but would have been a semester behind everyone with meeting people and getting comfortable there.  Freshman year is a huge transition, and even worse with the pandemic.  Just give it more time and it will get better.
comment,New Student,positive,v relatable. i'm a sophomore who had more chances to make friends than you cus of real life school but still didn't work out great :( I still wanna transfer ngl. also have nowhere to live next year haha. feel free to dm me if you wanna talk about it

comment,Degree,neutral,Its gotta depend on the major and school youre coming from and going to. I knownthe college of engineering requires a list of prereqs and a 3.0 in those classes (calc1-3 and diffeq/linear, physical chemistry(1 and 2), physics(250), a intro to engineering class or something, and a specific english class) check the website for the school you want. Takk to an advisor from that school
comment,Degree,neutral,To my knowledge, it‚Äôs usually not bad at all, except with Ross it‚Äôs a bit more competitive.  Public health, the College of Pharmacy and CoE, is not that bad.  Good luck!
comment,Degree,positive,Across college varies. But transferring within a college is usually as easy as meeting with your advisor in your current department and maybe another meeting with another advisor from the new department. Tbh it could be done with 2 phone calls in 10 minutes often times.
post,Health / Wellness,neutral,This past semester has been super rough for me emotionally. I have depression/anxiety and ADHD, but my latest depressive episode has been the most debilitating mental health issue I've ever had. I've skipped classes, dropped classes, haven't done homework assignments, etc. Meanwhile, I'm left with 3 4 credit classes, one of which has a 10 page research paper due next week that I haven't started yet. I'm also taking EECS 203 for the second time, and the second midterm is next week as well. I'm on track to fail EECS 203 again, and I just don't know what to do. If I could get assignments dropped due to my episode, it'd be helpful, but it doesn't seem like they do that. I see a psychiatrist regularly, and he suggested that I try and get accommodations for my depression. I just don't know how to go about doing that because then I feel like I'm using it as am excuse. Anyone have any thoughts on what I should do?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,You should contact the Dean of Students Office for help. Their team can connect you to accommodations and resources.   https://deanofstudents.umich.edu/critical-incidents   They‚Äôll likely route you to Services for Students with Disabilities for longer term accommodations, but the Dean of Students Office team is good at triage for pressing things like your current course assignments.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Have you contacted your professors with the demonstration that you have certain issues, and ask if you could take an incomplete? With the summer months coming up, you could potentially use some time (like the first month) to complete whatever assignments that you haven't done and change the I grade to an actual grade.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Get in touch with your professors ASAP! I‚Äôve been in a bad depressive episode since January and my professors have been really nice about it. My ASL professor accepts late assignments with no penalty. I know it‚Äôs scary to let them know but the sooner you do, the sooner something can be done for you üíô
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I just want to say I‚Äôve been there. Exactly there. I feel for you, and I believe in you. You will make it - at the same time, it‚Äôs okay to be not okay. As demoralizing and tough as it can be, please reach out to the course staff. I can at least speak for 203, they were very helpful. If there‚Äôs an IA or prof that you particularly feel comfortable with just send them an email or catch them after class or during OH and talk about it. They will help you and the sooner you ask, the more they can help. I personally got a lot of help and support from Prof. Graetz, and I‚Äôm positive you could too.   Best of luck! You are not alone.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Btw, you can petition the department for third attempts at 203/280/281. Your situation sounds like one that could be approved should you need it.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Do you already get accommodations for your ADHD through SSD? They might be able to help you as well as add mental health to your list of reasons for needing accommodations and your psychiatrist can explain that you will need extensions or special meetings with professors...
post,Miscellaneous,positive,That wellness day wasn't enough; has anyone had a massage place they've really enjoyed around the Central Campus area?

post,Event,positive,Link to website: [https://commencement.umich.edu/](https://commencement.umich.edu/)  Email from Schlissel:   " Dear Graduating Students:  We want to share the news that we will open Michigan Stadium to graduates during our May 1 virtual commencement ceremony.   We‚Äôre  adding this opportunity to help those graduates who want to celebrate  their accomplishments together following two important changes: The  state of Michigan has increased the allowed capacity of outdoor  stadiums, and we are seeing far fewer COVID-19 cases among students.  The plans we‚Äôve announced previously for commencement have not changed. The¬†ceremony  itself will be virtual with synchronous content viewable by everyone,  so all graduating students wherever they choose to be and their friends  and loved ones can see the ceremony at the same time. It will also be  archived for future online viewing. The  Rackham Graduate Exercises and the different types of graduation  ceremonies held by organizations, student groups and our Ann Arbor  schools and colleges will remain virtual, as well.  And the Michigan Stadium photo opportunity will proceed as planned.   To  help us do this safely, we‚Äôre limiting Michigan Stadium access on May 1  to Winter 2020 and Spring 2021 graduates, requiring full ResponsiBLUE  compliance, and will stagger entry to the stadium. Everyone will have a  ticket to a specific seat. For the full list of safety protocols, along  with what you can expect while in the stadium, please visit our [commencement website](https://commencement.umich.edu/).¬†   All  graduates who missed out on an in-person ceremony due to COVID-19 are  invited to attend and participate in any other future  main¬†commencement¬†of their choosing.¬†This invitation stands regardless  of whether you opt to view commencement in the stadium May 1.   Graduation  is such a special time for all of us at U-M, and we want to make this  milestone in your lives as memorable as possible. We‚Äôre grateful that  changes in public health guidelines and conditions now allow us to  provide the experience of being in Michigan Stadium along with  classmates when your hard-earned degrees are conferred.   We  very much appreciate your continued diligence to the health and safety  of our community and look forward to your continuing partnership to make  this opportunity successful on May 1.   Sincerely,  Mark S. Schlissel    President  Susan M. Collins    Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs"

comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm also curious about this, especially in regards to how it stacks up against the MSI since that can be completed in one year through the 2+1 program if you complete a BSI.

post,Finances,neutral,About a week ago, I was accepted to UMich LSA as a OOS transfer student from NY State (currently a first year college student attending a SUNY right now). I applied to LSA's Program in the Environment.   I got my financial aid package from UMich today, but to my dismay the expected cost of attendance is much more than what I can afford. I understand that as an OOS I should be paying more, but the  cost per *semester* at UMich is more than twice my cost per *year* at my current school.      What should I do? Should I contact the financial aid office and ask for more aid? (through phone or email)? Are there any other options I can explore (excluding loans)? I basically need advice - I really do want to go to umich but financial aid is not looking it ://
comment,Finances,positive,I was in the same situation with financial aid when I got in. I applied for an LSA scholarship and got it which, on top of my financial aid, made the price more realistic. I'd recommend going to the LSA scholarship website and seeing if you qualify for any of the renewable scholarships.

comment,Class,neutral,Do you have any advice for someone taking it next semester? Is there any way to prep?
comment,Class,positive,I think it‚Äôs actually one of the best EECS classes in terms of IAs/instructors being helpful and answering questions on Piazza and Office Hours but the workload is heavy and the lack of breaks this semester makes it super overwhelming. I feel like I‚Äôm not the only one putting a ton of effort into it, constantly watching lectures and working on projects all day and still struggling.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey guys, I recently got admitted into Michigan‚Äôs MSE program in Aerospace engineering, and was trying to find out if there are any engineering grad students who can give what their experience has been like. I guess mostly I‚Äôm concerned about the workload and what you guys do in your free time, as well as any potential alumni who can speak on what they went on to do after. I‚Äôve narrowed down my choices between here and Purdue and I‚Äôm just having a tough time deciding between the 2.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Not an aerospace student myself but a good friend of mine is in the aerospace program and he‚Äôs a super avid biker doing 100+ miles a week and managed to get a puppy during grad school (and puppies are a lot of work)  I think in a lot of ways grad school is what you make of it but this friend for example has been able to carve a balance while being in the program  The other aerospace master students I know also seem to have a similar work life balance, but all of them did undergrad here so I don‚Äôt know if that department familiarity / being a part of SUGS impacted that. Also all of these individuals have left Michigan working for NASA/JPL.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I've taken a class from the department (Rocket Prop), but it varies with the course, like all things.  I'm also not from the Aero department so idk about the overall curriculum, but can relate it to my present and past department.        Workload:  I've found the workload of online/remote courses to be slightly lower than my undergrad in MechE at Umich and the Robotics classes I took, about even with the in-person grad courses in the CLASP department in the before times.     Free time: Remote has been miserable in that regard.  If you get involved with a design team or student org, it is probably better.  I've worked on some side projects with randos, those were fun and engaging.  I'm a bad example, as my cohort graduated while I was pulled away from my program for a year.  I returned remote and lost in the sauce.      What I did after Undergrad at Umich: Federal government employee in defense   What I'll probably do after graduation based on current interviews success/etc:  Private Contractor in Space/Defense, or hopefully an FFRDC   What my cohort/classmates who graduated before me did: 2x JPL, 2x NASA, 1x Raytheon Missile Systems, 1x Rocket Lab, 1x Northrup (Former Orbital ATK), 1x More School (PhD), a couple smallsat companies, and a few other similar places
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Took a few courses (aerosp 523, 623) from the Aerospace department a few years ago. K. Fidkowski is probably the one of the best professors I've ever had. He teaches like he cares about you. His courses are **hard** that involves a ton of programming and math, but you learn a lot and KFid will literally respond to your email late at night if you have a question. I definitely pulled out a few all-nighters trying to get those projects done...  The department is pretty famous for housing a bunch of famous professors in the (computational) fluids field too.

post,Housing,neutral,Are there any cheap apartments in A2?
comment,Housing,positive,Yeah, of course. General rule of thumb: the farther you get from central campus, the cheaper the rents become. You can find plenty of studios and 1 bedrooms under $1,000 that are a 10-15 minute drive from central campus.
comment,Housing,neutral,Check out Tappan. I‚Äôm in an apartment rn (829) that‚Äôs 700 each for two people each with their own bedroom.
comment,Housing,positive,Are you in particular looking for North or south campus? Cuz the prices and quality varies between the two. North campus apartments in my opinion are nicer than central campus apartments at the same price. (Also, north campus tends to be roomier in general) However if you're not into walking a bit to a bus stop and you don't have majority north campus classes then it's best not to live up here.   But anyways, the reason I'm commenting, is I'm just off north campus (across the street from northwoods 3 and the courtyard apartments), looking for 1-2 roommates to fill 1 bedroom, less than 1k total for the asking share of rent and utilities. However, I strongly urge you to find somewhere that fits best location wise cuz if you're like me, going all the way to central can be a chore some days especially with the covid bus routes.
comment,Housing,positive,The Courtyards is a pretty good option, in all honesty. It's on north but right on the bursley-baits bus loop, so you don't need a car at all. You can lease in a 4b/4b for about 900 a month with utilities included. They definitely aren't the newest or most glamorous apartments, but for the price you really can't beat it
comment,Housing,positive,if you‚Äôre willing to share a room together, the coops are really close on campus and the cost includes the utilities (which costs you $60-90 off campus), food (you won‚Äôt have to worry about going grocery shopping!! huge time and money saver) and it‚Äôs fully furnished which can be a big issue when ur looking at cheaper apartments. i‚Äôd recommend truth coop   https://youtu.be/UHIWAgJOsXA house tour video and www.icc.coop has contract info and stuff! it‚Äôs like $700 a person but then you have literally all the food you need and dinner cooked for you. i recently did a good project for class it‚Äôs almost impossible for a solo person to live on $120 only of food a month with nutritional aspects and variety etc, but of the $700 you pay like $120 is food and you have such a selection! that cost also includes utilities and laundry and parking etc
comment,Housing,positive,I think it's very possible, and it definitely helps if you get on apartment hunting early rather than later when there are slim pickings. Due to COVID, though, I feel like there are still many more options out there now than there normally would be this time any other year.  For reference: Last year I had a studio near Ross and it was $995/mo This year I have a studio in Kerrytown for $935/mo  Both under $1k, is definitely possible. My $935 place is much nicer than the more expensive place, too.
comment,Housing,positive,Check out Oxford apartments pretty good location and decently cheap
post,Student Organization,positive,Anyone can give me a response, but preferably CoE freshman (because I am a male EECS freshie). Currently, I'm on the hunt for some academic opportunities, and need to see what I'm going to be doing so that I can start looking for housing for the 21-22 year. Keep in mind: I am currently in one social org (asian american association, will join VSA this or next year), I have a very, very limited resume (no work experience at all), and I'd like to travel to Florida some time in the summer.  1. Does anyone know of any academic-related summer opportunities open to engineering freshmen? I'd prefer if the opportunity is online. Are there any open clubs, projects, research, etc? It seems like co-ops, internships, and research are for sophomore/junior year and are typically in-person. If upper-classmen can speak on their experiences in past or current clubs they're in, that'd be great! 2. What are the best engineering clubs right now? Any specific electrical engineering clubs that are good? I have done some research and am not interested in ArborHacks or some hacking club. Data science looks uninteresting as well (feel free to change my mind!). Coding is interesting in general, though. The big projects like MASA, MRover, etc. look interesting but when should I join one of them?  If I don't end up doing anything for the summer, I will probably take Physics 240 in the summer via community college online.
comment,Student Organization,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Student Organization,positive,I would highly recommend joining Masa, this gem does some amazing stuff, and we are working to launch the largest college liquid rocket into space this December, and will hopefully break the current records. There is a lot of great avionics work that needs EECS students, and a ton of flight and propulsion simulators that require coding. Don‚Äôt think that masa is just an aerospace club, there is so much more to it. There is also a ton of opportunities to do work this summer, as we ramp up to build our rocket, so I‚Äôm sure you will find a project to work on. There is a high learning curve, but if you stick with it long enough everything will become second nature. Feel free to PM me your uniquname and I can add you to the slack so you can get started right away.
post,Class,neutral,For those who have taken MCDB 310, do the GSIs really look at every single detail of the cell map when grading?
comment,Class,positive,Honestly no, especially not with Covid. Just include everything on the rubric and do your best to draw as many arrows as possible. Don‚Äôt get too bogged down in the details, that stupid thing took me forever
post,Prospective Student,positive,I applied to transfer from Washtenaw CC to LSA in the fall but I recently heard back and they asked for my in progress grades? I‚Äôm not sure what to submit since I do not think teachers turned in midterm grades this semester? Anyone else experience this?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Idk about Washtenaw, but at Lancing CC we can go to our banner accounts (banner has financial aid info and it's how we register for classes) and there is a button that says "unofficial academic transcripts" that gives you your current g.p.a. On that document, there is a section called "Courses in progress". Do you guys have something like that?

post,Class,positive,Has anyone taken the online spanish placement exam? I put off taking the exam and now I'm a Junior and need to take it. I took 5 years of Spanish in middle school and high school but I'm pretty rusty. What should I expect on the exam? Is it a lot of conjugation and grammar?
comment,Class,positive,There definitely was a lot of grammar and vocabulary. I would recommend having proper time management because I ran out of time at the end of the exam, making me guess on a few questions that could have hurt my overall score a bit. You might have to respond to audio questions as well!
comment,Class,positive,I took it when I transferred a few years ago. I really don't think we can/should go into the specifics of it because of honor code, but you should know words and grammar.  Ridiculous but effective tip: Watch some U.S. cartoons that have been translated to Spanish. If you can follow along with the characters, you should be golden for the test. Personally, I recommend Ed Edd n' Eddy lol
comment,Class,positive,I took it in my sophomore year and was surprised at how much I remembered! If you always generally a good spanish student, you'll most likely be fine.
comment,Class,positive,That‚Äôs the thing w the US, they teach u the grammar and vocabulary w out actually giving u the opportunity to practice it, so u lose it. Thank god for my French Canadian parents who taught me French, and my old school (a French school) that gave me the tools to speak, read and write. I‚Äôm forever grateful for that
post,Miscellaneous,negative,I've been in a relationship my first three years here so I haven't really experienced it, but it's something I want to take into account moving forward.  Also, before anyone says anything, no, I'm not stringing him along. He's been pretty abusive physically and verbally. His most recent endeavor involved him screaming at me, blocking my way to my anxiety meds, and punching the door before slamming it. I left for a walk and came back to a literal hole punched in yet another door. Also, he sorta moved into my apartment without telling me a semester ago and I didn't really care enough to tell him no, saved me money on rent anyway. Well, I'm irresponsible with money and no longer have what I need saved up to afford the place on my own üò¨. So rn I'm pretty financially dependent on staying with him, but I feel it'd probably be better for me in other areas of my life to leave.  Part of me believes that no one else will ever want me--damaged goods from a poor family and all that. And another part of me thinks this university is too big to ever even be able to find someone. Then there's the whole complicated mess of love, abuse, trauma, guilt, finances, and the pandemic. I feel isolated enough as it is without going through a break up. I guess I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons. Stay and fix it/him or leave and deal with the consequences
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I say this with love: You can‚Äôt fix him.   Please trust your instincts. Get out before the abuse escalates.   I think there are likely resources on campus or in greater Ann Arbor to help you with the expenses of moving out of an abusive situation. My first thoughts are SAPAC and Safe House - and maybe the Dean of Students team. If you want my help finding resources, PM me and I‚Äôll do my best.   https://www.dpss.umich.edu/content/prevention-education/safety-tips/domestic-violence/
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Staying with someone just because you aren‚Äôt sure you will be able to find someone new immediately after is unhealthy. It sounds like maybe you should just look for a platonic roommate to take your boyfriends spot so you can recover from this unhealthy relationship, recover financially, and remember what it is like to live life in a non-toxic environment. But, like on most college campuses, there is a decent sized dating scene, however I‚Äôd say the majority of guys just want to hook up which kinda sucks.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,You can absolutely find someone who doesn‚Äôt treat you like garbage   Regardless of the Ann Arbor/UMich dating scene, you matter most and the abuse you‚Äôre facing isn‚Äôt your fault. I know leaving isn‚Äôt easy but nothing you‚Äôve outlined is part of a healthy relationship.  There are lots of resources to help you transition  to a better situation and can help you with finances/housing etc. consider looking at MDHHS which is the states network or the UM abuse hurts site
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I had an (admittedly very different) relationship problem, and I found r/relationships to be super helpful.  Strictly speaking to your question, I've found the dating scene here to be pretty good, and I suspect it will improve as more people get vaccinated. You will definitely be able to find a relationship with someone who doesn't make you fear for your physical safety, as that is truly unnacceptable behavior on his part.  I will also say domestic violence can be a grounds for terminating a lease so you could hopefully find a more affordable place.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Might not be my place but maybe practice good money management and make sure you are in a decent mental place before another relationship to protect yourself against this. Not blaming you just saying its for the best to do this.

comment,Meme,positive,we had a wellness day?
post,New Student,negative,I transferred to UM last fall- and I will go ahead and say that this was a very poor decision on my behalf. Ever since I have arrived here, I‚Äôve been disappointed over and over with the quality of what I‚Äôm receiving- and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it‚Äôs just me or if this school really is this awful.   For background- I went to UM- Flint last year for my freshman year. Classes weren‚Äôt too big, professors generally knew you by name, but the classes were pretty manageable. I worked a full time job while attending in-person classes full time as well. It was difficult at times, but man did i take it for granted.   Now, ever since coming to Ann Arbor, I can‚Äôt even think about my college experience without breaking down and crying. I took Orgo I during my first semester at UM- Ann Arbor per the suggestion of my advisor. Absolutely awful. One exam was so unfair the professors received hate Mail over it!! The average on every exam was like a 60%! Do you know how defeating it is to study on end for 20 hours PLUS for an exam and only receive a 60 percent?! Either these professors don‚Äôt teach what they‚Äôre testing over or they‚Äôre purposefully torturing their students for trying. Either way this was the first sign that I had made a mistake by coming to Ann Arbor.  Fast forward to this semester, I have survived orgo I and surprisingly got a B in the class! (This would be impressive if a B wasn‚Äôt a 67%...) However, now I am confronted with the hate crime of a class called ‚Äúmath 115.‚Äù For context, I took AP Calc AB in high school, got an A in the class, and a 4 on the national exam (not too bad right? Wrong.) Since I did not get a 5, but merely a 4...,,, this credit does not transfer to this ‚Äúgod-tier‚Äù school. Awesome.  This class is worse than I ever expected. Our only lectures are literal 4-5 minute YouTube videos and during the class sessions the GSI presents no new information. I‚Äôm sorry- Who learns calculus from subpar VIDEOS and nothing more?  But it gets better!  After 4 weeks in the class, our professor finally sends an email introducing herself (I didn‚Äôt even know she existed until this point)-  I thought I did not have an actual professor as I had only the contact information and name of my GSI.  I was spending so much time watching the stupid videos, reading the book, looking online, and even facetiming my old AP Calc teacher- all of this wasn‚Äôt enough for me to learn the material by myself and the format of the class just was not working. After having a mental breakdown during a quiz, I finally decided to reach out to this professor expressing my concerns for the course as I believed the course was not providing adequate enough resources in order to succeed. This class had been causing me mental breakdowns nearly daily at this point so a minor complaint was well warranted. I was hoping she would work with me so that I was not suffering just to pass a class I had essentially already taken.   The email that I sent was extremely emotional and begged for any kind of help she could offer or suggest. It has been over a month since I sent this original email and she has decided to not respond. I sent her another email in response to my prior email, calling her out for not even responding- she has decided to ignore that one as well. Is it really too much to ask for a response from a professor who literally does none of the work for the course already? It‚Äôs blatantly disrespectful to ignore the email that I had sent as it was clearly emotional and a desperate plea for any help at all that she could suggest. No response.   Overall my experience here has been so traumatic I probably won‚Äôt be attending school in the fall. I‚Äôve been pushed too far and expected to put my grades above my well being it feels like. Every time I contact someone to try and help the situation, they clearly do not care and don‚Äôt seem to acknowledge what I am actually saying. There is a problem at this school- much bigger than one student. The professors are pushing their students too far and not providing adequate resources. They keep claiming that they are there for their students but I have yet to hear that the students would say they have see any proof of this at all. It‚Äôs just so sad. This was my dream school and it‚Äôs ruined me.   Does anyone else feel like this? Is this normal here? Is it only because the classes are online? Or is it always this bad?
comment,New Student,positive,Michigan is a research institution. The professors are not hired for there ability to teach. This is not a pandemic phenomena, I have heard stories going back to the 70s of professors that did not want any kind of interaction with their students. WCC actually has many great teachers that didn't gain tenure at Michigan.  Depending on what your major is, it could be advantageous to take some prereqs at wcc. It is way cheaper and could give you a less stressful semester. Without any kind of real college experience in the corona times, I know I would be aiming to save the money and do that.
comment,New Student,positive,> I‚Äôve been pushed too far and expected to put my grades above my well being it feels like  Honestly this isn‚Äôt too uncommon at Michigan. However, the two classes you mentioned (Orgo I and Math 115) are notoriously bad. If you decide to stay, your upper levels will likely be much much better
comment,New Student,negative,It definitely feels ten times worse than any other semester I‚Äôve had. I had a family death two weeks before classes started and I seriously thought about withdrawing. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even want to continue the semester at this point
comment,New Student,positive,> The average on every exam was like a  60%! Do you know how defeating it is to study on end for 20 hours PLUS  for an exam and only receive a 60 percent?! Either these professors  don‚Äôt teach what they‚Äôre testing over or they‚Äôre purposefully torturing  their students for trying.   >   >\[...\]   >   >Fast forward to this semester, I have survived orgo I and surprisingly got a B in the class!  This is pretty normal at UMich (and most other high ranked universities, to my knowledge). I've gotten 60% grades on my exams before and been thrilled because the median was something like a 55%. You pretty much need to mentally detach yourself from your raw scores since they don't mean much; generally, as long as you're at least close to average, you can rest assured that you've got a good enough handle on the material, and that you'll end with a decent grade.  &#x200B;  >It‚Äôs blatantly disrespectful to ignore the email that I had sent as it  was clearly emotional and a desperate plea for any help at all that she  could suggest. No response.   Looks like you just got a bad draw with this one. Professors have pretty much always been responsive and understanding whenever I've reached out to them. You may need to bump a GSI or something to get your professor to look at her inbox. Keep in mind that Calc 1/2 and Orgo are famously poor courses here, as someone else already mentioned, so it will most certainly get better.  &#x200B;  >There is a problem at this school- much bigger than one student. The  professors are pushing their students too far and not providing adequate  resources.    Everyone at every school is feeling this to some extent right now. We are all trying to learn incredibly complex material that was never meant to be learned online. Schools/professors have to find a perfect balance between "academic rigor" and "stress-free learning", where no perfect balance exists for rigorous schools.  So, while it's not always this bad, it's still a very tough school and you're gonna need to put in a ton of work if you want to max out your GPA.
comment,New Student,positive,Hey! I'm sorry this is your experience so far. You sorta got unlucky with the classes your taking, especially just starting at umich. Both orgo 1 and calc are pretty notorious for being unnecessarily difficult but it's not really representative of the entire school I think. In my experience, more advanced science classes (including orgo 2 if you were considering taking that) are better, I would not say easier, but the material is genuinely more interesting and enjoyable to learn.  In regards to workload, this semester seems particularly terrible but I don't think it was always like this. Although I am only a sophomore, my freshman year was def less stressful than this. Granted, I took easier classes but still. Since it sounds like you're also in LSA, and we have a bunch of distribution requirements, I always try to have one humanities/social science class mixed in with all the STEM to lighten the load a little bit. Idk how much my comment actually helps but hang in there! You got it
comment,New Student,negative,I‚Äôm sorry you are having such a bad experience. Two things:  1) yes, this semester (and last) were MUCH worse than normal. It is a crime that we are still paying full tuition for an online education that everybody knows isn‚Äôt half of what we used to get (which was already vastly overpriced lol) 2) idk about orgo, but the calc sequence is basically what one might call weeder classes. Just try to pass them, things do get easier.
comment,New Student,negative,I‚Äôm not even gonna lie but yeah. At least from my experience in engineering, they generally don‚Äôt care unless you are actually dying. As in on your deathbed. You can get minor extensions if you are having health related problems but outright they‚Äôll say you can drop some classes and finish them later. Some professors are understanding but uofm admin prevents any kind of personable treatment from occurring. It‚Äôs also a bloated bureaucratic mess in terms of getting your medical con reviewed and ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù, so you can sit there for a while waiting for a committee to say that your disease is, in fact, real. At the same time, I doubt any other large college or competitively ranked college for that matter will give you different treatment. This is because colleges are to an extent a reflection of American society at large, if you feel bad or sick at your job you won‚Äôt be getting any extensions or days off past the given 2-3 weeks a year and will likely be laid off instead.
comment,New Student,positive,I'm so sorry that you're struggling with your courses.  I've been working with students on this campus for well over a decade and I can assure you that this is a mixture of COVID and the normal stressors of those courses and their rigorous demands.  I would absolutely do two things: 1) talk to your LSA advisor about your frustrations and future plans and 2) reach out to the student services folks in the math department's undergrad office ([math-undergrad-office@umich.edu](mailto:math-undergrad-office@umich.edu)) .  Staff in student services can help with getting a response.   Are you in a study group for the course?  I know it won't solve the problem but it gives you a chance to both talk to others who are likely having the same issues and give you strength in numbers if others wish to also voice their concerns.  If you can't get a response, you can also consider reaching out to the Ombuds office.    I can also tell you that upper-level courses tend to be smaller and more personal, and you'll be much more likely to get  to know the instructors.
comment,New Student,negative,Well, from the perspective of someone who grew up in a cornfield and arrived at umich super underprepared, even though it was my dream school and nobody from my high school would ever get accepted, struggled brutally for two years, changed majors, stayed another 3 for undergrad, and is currently unexpectedly here for grad, here's my textwall thoughtdump:  (TLDR: you're taking classes badly run enough to be notorious for it, things are extra shite right now, but they'll be back to normal come fall, though some things will still suck ass under normal conditions anyway)  **Orgo and Math**: these classes are notoriously awful even in a non-corona year and are treated like "weeders" in the sense that they are needlessly a pain in the ass. This is why so many people take their Calc1/2/3/4 at Washtenaw Community College or similar over the summer and transfer it in. I tried doing it (115) at umich and had to drop because I was under the struggle bus. I also basically got so close to failing out of my original major that I just jumped ship on it and had to change to something that was easier for me to handle because there was less emphasis on weeder course bullshit I couldn't get through, which is really when my mental health and quality of life took a turn for the better.  You're not wrong in recognizing some courses are just run in a very cognitively grindy and fucked-up way, but an unfortunate part of adapting to UMich, or maybe just college in general, is figuring out your own limits and figuring out what kind of tradeoffs you're willing to make in terms of your goals versus your quality-of-life, and as a school that takes in a lot of type-A-personality-folk, it can be a mental/culture/experiential shock to the system for a lot of us having to adapt to that way of thinking, where we're forced to recognize limits we weren't driven that close to at our former schools.  **Re: classes being online**, yeah, that does make things a lot worse, but some courses (Orgo, Any Calc, EECS 203/281, etc) are just always a landmine you don't want to step on unless necessary.  I've definitely had a harder time learning certain types of topics online and felt like overall I'm mostly teaching myself things in about half of my courses, more last term than this term.  **Re: your comment about the pandemic**  The pandemic response is definitely a bit fucked, but I don't think anyone could have genuinely fully convinced themselves with the unrealistic expectation of an in-person fall 2020 during the middle of a global pandemic. That said, the U pretending it was on the board was a shite move. Cutting fall and spring break made 100% sense, but also, they should've split them up and given us more like 4-5 wellness days and not 2, which was jank and soul-draining.  **Re: vaccination & fall 2021**  I mean, by fall everyone with half a brain (who can safely be vaccinated) will be vaccinated, so it wouldn't make sense for things to *not* be on-campus and back-to-normal by fall semester unless we get a whole shiny new corona virus. As much fun as it can be to shit on the administration, it just doesn't feel logically coherent that there'd be another online-only semester like this after spring/summer are done.
comment,New Student,positive,I went from all A's in high school to struggling with some of the weeder classes. Try not to take your grades too personally. C's get degrees. And as someone above said, trades are a great idea. Plumbers make bank.
comment,New Student,negative,I also transfered to Ann Arbor. I came from UM-Dearborn, but I transfered at the beginning of the last academic year. Fortunately, I've had mostly positive experiences transferring. I was able to get an understanding of the campus before zoom university kicked in. While obviously there are many differences between the different campuses, I found UofM-AA to be much more put together school, once you get past the much larger class sizes. I believe much of the problems you are having with the school to be from the pandemic issues, as basically everybody has problems with how UofM is handling the online format.
comment,New Student,positive,From my experience at UofM it's more of a school for graduates than undergraduates. The biggest benefits you get from undergraduate is a cool student population, good reputation, and the possibility to make graduate inroads. The teaching quality is not better than anywhere else and the classes are graded more harshly, making it more likely you'll leave with a lower gpa. I suggest UofM if you're very intelligent, very hard working, and plan on going to graduate school. If you're just a normal smart person you're better off going to another school, getting a higher gpa, and then moving onto either graduate school or career.
comment,New Student,neutral,I also would like to add that the entire response to the pandemic from this school is really horrible. Increased tuition, the false promise of a normal fall 2020 semester, no breaks, heavier workload on the students, essentially no cut-out requirements for profs who are seemingly getting away with murder. Am I missing anything?   Let‚Äôs also take the time to discuss the ~perfect~ timing to announce that they are expecting classes to be ~normal~ in the fall....just weeks before registration opens.... this feels.. all too familiar? I wonder if they will wait until a week before classes start to change their format in the school website again.   Should we also talk about their promise to vaccinate all students? I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs necessary. You get my point.
comment,New Student,positive,I haven‚Äôt had the displeasure of taking Orgo, but I took Math 115 last semester, and I just thank my lucky stars I took HL IB Math or I‚Äôd be completely clueless with it. Math isn‚Äôt my strongest subject to begin with, and the way the GSI‚Äôs attempted to teach it (wouldn‚Äôt say that mine really taught anything) was awful.   I‚Äôm sorry this has been your experience with the school so far, I‚Äôm a freshman myself so I‚Äôm new as well, but I‚Äôve had a decent time in other classes. Maybe it gets better as time goes on?
comment,New Student,positive,I started this way too. In my first semester, I was suggested by my advisor to take Physics 240, EECS 183, and Psych 270. Both EECS 183 and Physics 240 were irrelevant to my degree choice- but my advisor insisted that I was too ignorant to know what degree I'd actually like to pursue (because I transferred from community college). Aside from that, Physics 240 was so difficult that I dropped it in my first semester.  Also, at my previous college, I took AP Calculus 2. It did not transfer because I hadn't covered one subsection of a section of a chapter in the textbook. The math department said that they wouldn't make accommodation for this because they didn't write exams for subsections of sections of chapters. My previous Calculus professor wrote a letter to UM's math department and they still wouldn't budge. I ended up retaking the class and barely passing (I only passed because I used my notes from the school that I transferred from). I even stopped reading the textbook because my old textbook was far superior.  In another class, when attending office hours to ask for feedback regarding poor-ish grades for certain assignments the professor told me: even if the assignment meets all of the criteria- it still isn't worth a 100% unless you go beyond what's expected in the class.    This school takes pride in the sleep deprived and overworked student stereotype. I used to work full-time as a student but now it's impossible with the workload and limited number of class sections available.  People say the community is great, too, but I haven't had that experience. I come from a poor background as a first generation student. The wealth disparity between myself and the average student already makes things somewhat more difficult. I had tons of friends at my previous college and have zero friends at Umich. The students here make me feel old- as if they're still in high school and I'm like 45 or something.  I'd say that things get better, but I've been here for two years and they haven't.
comment,New Student,neutral,Nobody should ever take the calculus sequence at Michigan
comment,New Student,positive,I definitely understand where you‚Äôre coming from and I have no doubt your future semesters will be better considering you will have more human interaction and hopefully take better classes. The first thing you should note is you‚Äôre taking 2 classes that are meant to give you breakdowns, as much as that sucks, it‚Äôs only because they want less determined students to drop out. In my first semester when I was taking calc 2 which is the same format as calc1, I literally said the same thing u did, that the quality of this education is trash, I took calc 1 at community college and i learned wayyy more. Just hang in there and don‚Äôt let some stupid weeder classes determine how good u are or what u can handle. I know it‚Äôs tough transitioning to a system where 3 exams are worth ur entire grade, but the upside is if u don‚Äôt do well u can convert to P.
comment,New Student,positive,One thing that might be helpful is if you apply to the CSP (Comprehensive Studies Program). They have smaller classes and they are longer for certain courses such as Math 115 that I found really helpful. Feel free to PM me as well if you are curious about the program. I am also curious what your major is and career goals. I am sorry that you‚Äôve had such a bad experience here but I hope you know there are students out there who care and want to help support you!
post,Housing,positive,It's time for me to re-up my graduate housing lease. Depending on my job situation, I may need to graduate in December 2021. The housing website states and staff have told me that, " *Neither graduation nor changes in eligibility are grounds for termination of the contract holder‚Äôs financial obligations under the contract.* " To me that sounds like if I graduate I won't be eligible to continue living there but will still have to pay for it, which just sounds bonkers and unenforceable to me. There is apparently a petition process to get out of your contract. Anyone have experience with this?i
comment,Housing,neutral,iirc, Northwood contracts will allow you to renew for a year past graduation. Also, you can do a lease takeover (at least for northwood). Right now they've been not allowed because pandemic, so they seem to just let people leave right now.
comment,Housing,positive,They‚Äôre easy to get out of from what I‚Äôve seen If you graduate they don‚Äôt expect you to remain in housing Just notifying housing and solidify an end date for your contract, they usually try to keep it to the 1st or 15th of a month

post,None,positive,I can't seem to figure out how to save a schedule!  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/mc9434)
comment,None,positive,For a first pass, it's okay. I'd have preferred being able to access both rather than be forced into a new system abruptly. I feel like the old schedule builder was better overall. I only have 2 classes that don't overlap to schedule though, so I didn't do much this year.
comment,None,positive,I like it. Wasn't difficult scheduling for this semester so maybe I wasn't using the more advanced features, but it seems to have done everything I needed it to do. The UI is nice and I'd say the layout is better than the old one, but the old one is by no means bad.  I'd say the Atlas website is very good overall, especially compared to most of the other shit we have to use ("new" Wolverine Access). Only complaint is it feels pretty sluggish searching for and loading classes. Schedule builder seems responsive enough.

Everyone was too nice that for some reason I even felt weird when surrounded by queer folks (?) Depends on what kind of environment you‚Äôre coming from, I think  Been in a long distance relationship for the past 4 years so can‚Äôt really speak for a2 dating culture.  Unsolicited information:  a2 trains your gaydar
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm graduated now but it‚Äôs great to be a lesbian wolverine (you gotta chant this). I only came out to myself junior year of college, and it was amazing (especially coming from a small conservative town) that what felt like a big huge crazy thing to me was so well received by everyone around me. The best way I can describe it is at home I would never randomly mention that I‚Äôm gay to a stranger, but at umich I‚Äôd feel comfortable telling any random person.   Everyone is chill and there are so many great groups and orgs you can join no matter what you study - check out the spectrum center! My studies led me to oSTEM and the women‚Äôs studies department, which is like a safe haven for anyone who wants or needs one.   Also dating wise totally good I think. I found my person at umich (tinder success üò©) and so have several of my wlw friends. Also important - I‚Äôve never felt uncomfortable like walking around holding hands with my gf or anything, which I really appreciate.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I can't speak to sororities or dorms with regards to being a lesbian really, but I'm a trans girl and honestly even I had a surprising amount of success on dating apps (and now have a girlfriend who I met on one), so in my totally subjective opinion it's pretty great. (Just try Bumble and Hinge, Tinder got me nowhere but the others got me dates lmao)  also there's the umich lgbtq+ discord lol: https://discord.gg/RRZGggb
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Finally, something I can speak for. It's totally fine. I haven't met one person who wasn't cool with my sexuality and if they did, they weren't verbal about it. Also, it's a large school, if you don't want to hang out with someone no one is forcing you (except for class but I haven't ever disclosed my sexuality during class) so basically you can easily cut people who you aren't vibing with.   There's a lot of lgbt here. I'm in lloyd scholars right now (program for artsy kids ig) and there's a ton in here lol. Plus there's clubs and other orgs specifically for lgbt.   I can't speak for everyone, nor do I have conclusive results, but I rushed and I got in so it's just about finding your people. (Still new tho so it could be subject to change but so far I've felt nothing but hospitality).   I find most of michigan tends to lean more progressive than conservative and even if then the conservative side isn't extreme at all. It's a midwest school in the north you'll be just fine.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,100% if you want a community experience that sororities claim they give, i‚Äôd recommend doing the co-ops instead. on average 50% of the houses are LGBTQ+ individuals and it‚Äôs so much fun being in the co-ops with the people you meet. People above mentioned the RC which has a pipeline into the icc co-ops because of how similar it can be people wise. I also enjoy it because food is still covered but i don‚Äôt have to worry about dpss etc.  the main website is www.icc.coop, and the instagram is @iccannarbor and the youtube is ICC Ann Arbor! highly recommend checking them out
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I would also recommend M-STEM if you are into science or engineering. It‚Äôs a wonderfully diverse program that encourages acceptance! It‚Äôs a program that you can do the summer before your freshman year and gives you the chance to make friends before school starts. I did it and I loved it.

post,COVID-19,positive,I‚Äôve been checking Rite Aid, Walgreens, Washtenaw County Health Dept, and Kroger night and day and they never seem to add any appointments for this area (or even anywhere within 25 miles).   I‚Äôm on the list for Meijer and UofM but I‚Äôm guessing they aren‚Äôt going to get back to me any time soon.   Has anyone had luck with getting an apt here? Does anyone know at what time they add new appointments for these sites or if they‚Äôre just our in this area? Or should I venture out of the county?   Thanks in advance!!
comment,COVID-19,neutral,r/annarbor has been keeping up with local and Ohio options for vaccines if you look through threads there
comment,COVID-19,positive,In addition to r/annarbor you could try r/coronavirusmichigan. I have been keeping an eye there for suggestions since I'm trying to find an appointment for my wife. There is also a Facebook group I've seen people talk about, Detroit Area Vaccine Hunters.   It does seem like pharmacies/grocery stores are going to be the quicker option, especially if you have the ability to drive a bit. It's a good thing that demand is so high in the area but I would guess once eligibility opens up for everyone on April 5th it will be even more bonkers.   I drove 2 hours to Clare last week to get my first shot at a Walgreens. Obviously it's a luxury to have that time to drive up there (and probably pushing past how far I thought I'd go for a shot), but if you are able to expand the search radius you should have more luck.  Edit: For anyone looking, [a good digest on places to search for open appointments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusMichigan/comments/m95z7w/howto_get_a_vaccine/)
comment,COVID-19,positive,My husband had to drive 2 hours to Midland. I was able to find one yesterday in Brighton. NO IDEA HOW and I was getting super annoyed and frustrated. Never saw anything in town at Walgreens, Kroger, Meijier, health department, etc. It's so much of a PITA too b/c you can't just log in once and keep checking. You have to look up zip codes to use and then refill out the forms each time etc. I ended up using a crowdsourced Excel document about Michigan sites but I cannot for my life remember where I found it. Maybe on Reddit? For sure one of the places listed in W county that it said had them did not though - I called to be sure. So grain of salt. I also ended up officially scheduling from a website that showed were available appointments were and how long ago it had found them. Let me see if I can find it...
comment,COVID-19,positive,Join the Detroit area vaccine hunters - Michigan Facebook page!!! There‚Äôs so much good information on there
comment,COVID-19,positive,Best bet is Lucas County/Toledo, Ohio area. They seem to open scheduling on a rotating basis in various Rite Aid pharmacies west of Toledo. They will accept Michigan residency no problem.  Also: [Lucas County Covid 19 vaccine scheduling ](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=21473466&fbclid=IwAR1hv7X72aJQDjxSkSt-KIR8h0aYxzBmVgIPi9Es-sLvXeGcEP_RXELtdA4)  Edit: As of 3/24 at 3:30pm, spots available at Rite Aid Wauseon, OH (43567), an hour-ish from Ann Arbor.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,If you can get out to Ford Field, Meijer is doing a bunch there. Got an appt very quick.
comment,COVID-19,positive,NOTE FOR OTHER STUDENTS: Michigan people age 16+ with a qualifying occupation OR medical condition, **including smoking or obesity**, can try to get an appointment at Rite Aid.  As other people mentioned, Ohio Rite Aid walk-ins are one approach...some of them take people regardless of qualifying criteria, so healthy, jobless students could go. Hour and a half drive, and walk-in means no guarantee; check for recent threads about this in /u/annarbor and /u/coronavirusmichigan for latest updates, and maybe try calling a store and talking to a person.  I've had success getting appointments for three people at specific Rite Aids in Michigan. The key is to keep retrying a location (clicking the Next button for a selected location) every second or so, and if you get to the calendar screen, VERY quickly selecting a time and clicking Next to lock in the appointment that just opened up. You can take your time filling out the rest of the web page (contact info, last 4 of social, doctor info, medical info, etc...you can skip things or answer "don't know" if you don't know) until it shows your confirmation number. It took me maybe an average of about 10 hours of clicking for each appointment. If you can't spend that much time at it, certain times seem to have more appointments opening than others, and maybe 11:45pm to 12:05am would be the best time block to go hard, or if you have more time, 10pm to 12:05am...I think I got one appointment around 10pm, and one around midnight. But appointments also seemed to start opening up early in the morning, like somewhere in the 7am to 9am range, and I also thought there were more in the 11am to 2pm range...I haven't heard others suggest those times, the way I've heard about near-midnight times, and I didn't collect detailed data on it to confirm, but that's my informal personal observation.  If  you have videos to watch on your computer, just shrink your Rite Aid browser window a bit, and move it half off the screen, so you can just keep clicking the Next button while you watch a vid in the other window.  On Rite Aid's Qualifier page, if you choose Michigan as the location, they currently seem to want either 65+ year olds, or 16+ year olds with a qualifying medical condition or occupation...smoking or obesity, among others, qualify you on Rite Aid's page at age 16+. If you choose Ohio, they want either 40+ year olds, or different qualifying criteria. Whichever location you choose on the qualifying page, you are asked for your full address on the appointment scheduling page once you snag an appointment.  If an appointment opens up at a location you're trying, but someone else gets it first, it might take several minutes before you can search for that location again...it keeps showing that the appointment is available, but you'll try to use it and it says someone else already took it. So try another location until it resets. I found sites that scan for open appointments using bots, like [vaxxmax.com](https://vaxxmax.com), are simply too slow to be useful...they might update a couple minutes after an appointment opens up, but other people or bots are probably clicking repeatedly, so a new appointment will probably be gone after two seconds, and sites like vaxxmax just show it as open for a few minutes due to the way Rite Aid shows appointments as available even if it's been taken, or quasi-taken as someone is filling out the rest of their info.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Apparently Rite Aids in Ohio are doing walk up clinics that don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre not from Ohio. I know probably 20 or so people who‚Äôve gone down to Ohio for their vaccine with no residence/affiliation to the state
comment,COVID-19,positive,I had to drive to a Kroger in toldeo OH for my vaccine. That‚Äôs probably your best bet
comment,COVID-19,neutral,My roommate and I got vaccinated yesterday at the Rite Aid in Napoleon, OH with a reserved second dose in three weeks. No appointment but it was a bit of a road trip. Call them, stay on the line past the robot, and ask if they‚Äôre doing walk-ins today.

post,Finances,neutral,I am an international student recently admitted to LSA, but probably won't be able to go because of the high price. Just wondering any fellow international student. How did you pay for college? Is there a scholarship or something I could apply for? Should I take a loan? Please if anyone has anyy tips drops them below. I just feel pissed that I won't be able to attend just because of my finances. Thanks
comment,Finances,positive,Not going to sugarcoat it at all - if you can't afford to pay for US colleges without taking a loan as an international student, you shouldn't attend. The US is not cheap for international students and the total cost of a bachelor's degree (+living expenses and travel costs) comes to about $300k. If you cannot prove you have sufficient and stable financials you will not be given a student visa.   I do suppose you could - theoretically - take out some large loan from your home country, but I don't think it's worth the stress. Supposing you do take a loan and study CS in LSA (arguably the highest paying college degree at the moment) and get a really good job, you'll expect to earn about $100k per year. Assuming you somehow manage to save $30k a year in that job, you'll have to wait at least 10 years just to pay off your bachelor's degree. This is assuming you study CS, the market doesn't saturate for foreigners, and that you manage to get good enough grades in your degree to land a job at a pretty solid company.    That being said, there's no reason to worry! Undergraduate education is relatively standardized across most good institutions around the world, so you certainly won't be missing out on a whole lot academically. Try either getting a bachelor's degree in your home country or in a third country that's cheaper to attend (certain European countries like France have very affordable education, even for foreigners). You can always come here for a master's or Ph.D. program. In fact, most of the international students I knew (who weren't born into wealthy families), were graduate students who have been given generous grants and funding to study and stay in the US.

comment,New Student,positive,Hello,  I got accepted as an international transfer student to LSA for the Spring 2021 term. I received a tentative transfer credit evaluation, but I can't seem to understand why the transfer credit term summary is blank i.e all the figures are NULL.   My official transcript submitted to UofM during the application shows that I'd earned 115 PDPU credits by fall 2020 (essentially- 76 UofM credits)  But, I can't understand why the transfer credit term summary is blank (please refer to the image). Does it mean that the credit evaluation is yet to be processed and that I've only been provided this report for reference?
comment,New Student,positive,Email ua-creditevaluation@umich.edu and ask them about it, they're pretty prompt with their replies. I'm a transfer student from India too, and had the same 0 credit tentative report. They asked me to submit an external credit evaluation.
post,New Student,positive,Hi people! I'm a new Wolverine who's transferring for Fall 2021 semester. I was wondering if having a car necessary as a student at Umich and living in AA. Like, will there be huge differences in my Umich life if I don't have a car? Thank you!
comment,New Student,positive,Absolutely not. Its so easy to walk around campus and the city. Plus there are two bus services, aata and the campus blue bus. Getting a bike makes it easier too
comment,New Student,positive,The only thing having a car is good for is going grocery shopping if you live in an apartment or house. However, delivery is vastly cheaper than a car.

post,Satellite Campus,positive,Hello everyone. I recently got admitted to University of Michigan Dearborn. I can't understand the tution per credit hour assessment system. When I use the graduate tution calculator, the tutoion fees would be more than $15,000 for 10 credits. But in I-20 tution amount mentioned was $29,000. Could anyone please tell me how will the tution cost to complete 30 credits at University of Michigan Dearborn for MS in Industrial Engineering.   I need to apply for the total loan amount based on this calculation. When I enquire with the respective department, I didn't get any proper reply for my questions.
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,The figure you are looking at is likely *per term*, whereas the financial document for your I-20 is indicating tuition and fee costs *per year* (two main academic terms per year). I am not very familiar with UM Dearborn on things like this, but based on a quick lookup of their tuition rates I think that is the case.   I know you mentioned you have not gotten a response from the department yet, but it would definitely be best to get confirmation from them or the UMD registrars office.

post,Class,positive,I have honestly **never** been in a situation where I felt a course was so poorly run- or that students were being so disrespected- that it warranted an actual complaint... Until this semester. I'm talking about EECS 496.  I'd like to think I have the discretion to be able to know when a class only *seems* bad to students due to extenuating circumstances, versus when a class is genuinely being mishandled. I and many other currently enrolled students would probably agree that this case is the latter, and I sincerely do not say that lightly.  I know sending in a complaint likely won't do a thing, but I feel like I'd be doing an injustice to the circumstances if all the needless chaos in the class went completely unrecognized on a formal level.  Are complaints filed at the Dean of Students? Or through the Office of Student Affairs? Or should I just send an email to the Engineering department contact?  Thank you for the help. Everybody else, please enjoy your wellbeing break!
comment,Class,neutral,I‚Äôm an EE and after this class I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt touch the CS department more than I absolutely had to over my four years. What a disgrace.
comment,Class,positive,I believe we had a thing in the groupme where we sent a formal complaint which led to a meeting between Chesney and Engineering Dean Gallimore, but I'm not really sure if much has come from it.    Honestly, I'm in the class too and I think the concerns are a bit overblown, I mean besides:    * Not responding to posts on Piazza and saying there's too many questions to answer   * Having the expectations for homework 1 being so vague they had to give everyone 2 extra points   * Giving us a tedious homework 2 of a minimum of 64 sentences which just felt like busy work (we actually got 100 good notes on a Piazza post complaining about this)   * Releasing HW 4a and 4b due on a Wednesday at 11:55 AM after explicitly stating we had no work that week during class and not sending a class wide announcement about it. (this one really pisses me off)   * Making students peer review most of the assignments   * Only allowing one regrade request per semester, despite the fact random students are the ones grading the assignments   * Having class go over time several times, and not addressing student's concerns until the end of class. I think one of the complaint sessions literally ended 90 minutes after class was supposed to end and another one went like at 30 minutes over when he posted a random unexplained participation assignment before class that didn't end up being anything   * Making guest speakers give us a homework question on the spot   * Not releasing a syllabus til week 8   * Making this homework a 2 page paper in IEEE format for some reason that's probably too much for a 2 credit class (along with week 2, but "they hear our concerns")   * Not clarifying participation grade after several requests then making an overly complicated and flawed equation for it like 8 weeks in   * Having a super big ego that's unwilling to meet student's concerns    I don't think Chesney's doing that bad of a job (/s)
comment,Class,positive,Hey! You can send your complaints through here: https://cse.engin.umich.edu/about/reporting-concerns-and-misconduct/  It will be sent to people who care about things like this i.e. Wes Weimer.   The more unique complaints there are, the more urgency these issues will get so anyone who can please fill it out!
comment,Class,positive,I think you've gotten the right advice already, so I'll just add this as a general rule:  Academic concerns should be reported through  academic channels, not through student life.  If it's a class, a program, a faculty member--this is academic and you should start with the school/college where this is located.  What may be a little confusing is that your school/college probably has some student affairs function (an office, or at least a person with this in their area of responsibility and title).  While they're typically more involved with non-academic parts of your experience, they may still be a reasonable resource because since they are located within the school or college, they report to the academic dean in some fashion.  The Dean of Students, and other divisions of the VP for Student Life, is different.  Those offices *support* the academic side but they aren't a part of the academic side.  They're primarily involved with things outside of academics.  They may collaborate with academic units on some things (Living learning communities, internships, etc) but the student life offices don't have authority over instruction, faculty, or curriculum.  So could you go to them about feeling stressed about academics?  Sure.  But for efforts where you are trying to change something about a particular or degree program--they're not the way to go.
comment,Class,neutral,I would try the Ombudsman for advice on avenues to submit your feedback.
post,New Student,positive,Hey all! I‚Äôm headed to AA this coming fall as a student athlete and was wondering if y‚Äôall could help answer some of my questions!  1. When does orientation typically happen?  2. Is this the same for international students? (I‚Äôm international)   3. When does class actually start?  4. What happens during orientation?  5. Is there skate culture in AA? Are there boardshops on or near campus?  6. Are you allowed to skate on campus as a mode of transport?  7. Are there any skateparks near or on campus?   Thanks!
comment,New Student,positive,1) Orientation is usually a 3 day thing you do anytime in the summer. You'll get invited to schedule it via email at somepoint.   2) I think international folk are still welcome to do the summertime 3-day one but there's also an international-specific orientation offered way late, closer to when classes start  3) August 31st. [\[2021-2022 academic calendar\]](https://ro.umich.edu/sites/default/files/2019-12/Cal_2021-2022.pdf)  4) Orientation was just like a blend of touring around campus, taking some placement exams if you want them (I think chemistry was the only one I had to do), plus sitting in lectures on things about campus, getting advising on scheduling, and then your last thing is actually registering. But if stuff is still online, no idea what it looks like now.  5) There's a lot of skateboard/longboard/rollerskate people around but the skateshop near campus, Launch, closed years ago, so I'm not really sure there's one around us anymore  6) Technically, skating on campus is a no-go under some regency rules I'm too lazy to go dig up right now, but the reality is you'll see a lot of people do it anyway and not get bothered by police over it. Just, theoretically, if DPSS *chooses* to fuck with you for it, they kinda can.  7) No clue if there are any around campus but I just got a board this week so also curious, haha
comment,New Student,positive,5. In AA, yes, at Umich, no. There's some locals who you'll see skating around pretty much every day when the weather is nice. Really friendly and always down to hit up a spot. Other than that you'll be stuck skating with gumpy mongo pushing longboarders/penny boarders.  Olympia skateshop is based out of Ypsilanti and they just opened up an Ann Arbor location downtown. I would definitely check that place out to make connections in the local skate community.  6. I don't know if it's allowed, but lots of people do it all the time and I've never heard of anybody getting in trouble for it.  7. There's a skatepark in Veteran's memorial park in AA, across the street from Aldi. In Ypsi there's Prospect DIY and a public skatepark just down the street from it.

Someplace that's either "uniquely Ann Arbor‚Äù or otherwise "a Wolverine favorite" would be great -- hoping to get a feel for the general vibe of the area.  Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Frita Batidos = Ann Arbor. The vibe‚Äôs not going to be as buzzy as usual, because pandemic, but it‚Äôs still a nice place.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I really like Rays Red Hot. Not sure if it‚Äôs a big UMich culture icon since I‚Äôve only been on campus during COVID and for just one semester, but it‚Äôs good stuff.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,My general recommendation is Jerusalem Garden, it's the place I'll take anyone who is in town for the first time. If you want a burger, Frita Batidos is good. Angelo's for breakfast stuff is a usual recommendation.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Obvious answer in Zingerman‚Äôs Deli. It‚Äôs expensive for a normal deli, but portions are big, quality of ingredients is very high, and it‚Äôs probably the most famous restaurant in town.   Id also include Frita Batidos. Cuban style burgers and shakes, overall delicious and a great lunch spot. I‚Äôve never really found another place that‚Äôs similar, so that‚Äôs a plus. A bit further from campus though.   If you are walking a ton and want to sit down and have a nicer lunch, I love Mani Osteria for Neapolitan style pizza.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,For good food that's also an Ann Arbor classic I'd recommend either Zingerman's Deli or Zingerman's Roadhouse. The deli is more casual but can be very busy (maybe not as much with covid) and the roadhouse is a bit nicer sit down place.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm floored nobody has said Krazy Jim's Blimpy Burger yet. Fantastic burger joint, just be sure to read their instructions before you get in line - it's part of the place's culture and history to chew out customers that can't follow their (simple) instructions. Great place.   Side rec to Insomnia for cookies for dessert.

comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Engineering is psychologically draining
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôve never heard of a joint program between engineering and psychology at Michigan.   Are you asking two separate questions?:  1) How is the College of Engineering? 2) How is the Psychology department within the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts?  Even then, those are vague questions. What in particular are you wondering about them? Faculty strength? Variety of classes? Research opportunities? Employment and internships? Grad school placement? Scholarships? Vibe and culture?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I did a double major in CS and psychology thru LSA  I can confirm that CS is brutal along with the rest of engineering (unless you do like IOE)  Psych was GPA booster and tbh there‚Äôs a ton of amazing professors in that department. A really wide range of classes too.  CS was to get a job and psych was to learn out of pure enjoyment (although I did end up writing a lot of essays which wasn‚Äôt fun bc I hate writing)

post,Degree,positive,What opinions do you have of the smaller michigan schools (Ford, Nursing, School of Information, Kinesiology)? We always make fun of ross and lsa but never talk about the smaller schools
comment,Degree,positive,You tryna make fun of the smaller schools?
comment,Degree,positive,I‚Äôve heard people joke that SI is for the people that couldn‚Äôt make the GPA cut for CS, kinda like the whole ‚Äúecon is for people who couldn‚Äôt get into ross‚Äù. Not necessarily my opinion though, I think the SI programs are super interesting.
comment,Degree,negative,(A relative serious comment) TBH, Standing from perspectives of a LSA Economics student, I sometimes admire students in SI and Ford School. Those schools have a lot of famous Economists, like Robert Axelrod in Ford who contributed significantly in reiterated prisoner's dilemma. Also, LSA Econ is way weaker than SI in experimental economics. You won‚Äôt be able to see much classes in that field either in undergrad or grad in LSA. It is a pity in my undergrad career:)
comment,Degree,positive,We love Ford don't worry ;)  edit: this is an inside joke pls ignore this comment
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi All,  I was admitted to U of M's Rackham Graduate School for the Master's In Computer Science and Engineering program. I'm super excited to have been admitted, given the caliber of the graduate engineering school, but I'm starting to second guess my feelings about wanting to attend given the costs, etc. (also got into my alma mater at a reduced rate on merit). I'd be going in with a concentration in Computer Security (hoping to work for the CIA or NSA afterwards).  For those that have been in the program / know more about it, is it worth the cost of attending? That goes for the quality of faculty, job placement after graduating, overall U of M AA community.  &#x200B;  Any input is helpful, and thanks for taking some time to read this! Thanks.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The CIA and NSA do go to umich career fairs regularly (engineering and entire school). They want you to apply 1-2 years out. Ann Arbor is a tech hub and there's usually a tech trek every year. Lots of companies go to umich career fairs and there are a lot of networking opportunities. There are a few meetups related to computer security in this area (I know at least 2 people that are heavily involved in those).   I only took one computer security course (EECS 388) to finish up my CS minor but the professors are really good and do lots of interesting research. I took it when it wasn't Halderman teaching so we had 4 professors rotating depending on topic that semester. I would compare the curriculum for both programs and try to figure out what classes are even available to take on a regular basis for security (not every course is offered every semester or year).   I grew up here so it just made sense to go to umich for both of my degrees so I'll let other people comment on the other stuff.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello Everyone!  I am a high school senior and a prospective pre-pharm student at UMich. I‚Äôm sort of confused on how the whole process works of being admitted to the pharmacy school after completing undergrad prerequisite classes at UMich. I understand that there is no such thing as a ‚Äúguaranteed program‚Äù like in other schools, but what do they mean by ‚Äúconditional assurance?‚Äù Essentially I am asking if getting into this program means getting a ‚Äúhigher chance‚Äù of being accepted to the School of Pharmacy, if I am guaranteed a spot given I complete the prerequisite courses/keep my GPA up, or if it gives me no advantage over any other applicant. I ask this because other schools have very clear 0-6 programs where you are guaranteed a spot in the school given you are accepted into the program, and this seems slightly differrent. Any help is appreciated!:)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hi! Pre-pharmacy, preferred admit junior here. It's technically not guaranteed like the 0-6 programs, but I haven't seen any preferred admits get rejected when they applied to pharmacy school. Also, you will be guaranteed an interview if you satisfy all of the requirements.   The main advantages that the preferred admission gives you are that the admissions committee will see that you were a preferred admit when you go to apply, you'll have social events with the other preferred admits 1-2 times a year, and you'll be connected to the Pre-Pharmacy Student Organization & the UMich College of Pharmacy right from the start of your freshman year.   Most people here, both preferred admit and non-preferred-admit, complete their Bachelor's degree and apply to pharmacy school during their senior year. (This is what I am doing). There's also the fast track program, where you would major in BS Pharmaceutical Sciences for 3 years and enter into pharmacy school a year early (some of the classes in the BS degree overlap with the PharmD, so they waive those classes to allow you to skip a year). You would still need to apply to the PharmD program though.  Congrats on getting into Michigan! If you have any questions, feel free to PM me :)

post,Health / Wellness,negative,I woke up this morning feeling so ill with a a stuffy nose, sore throat, and overall tiredness. I got a negative rapid COVID test this morning thankfully, but I don't think I've ever had this bad of a reaction to the changing of the weather. I was outside like all day yesterday too which I am sure did not help. Is anyone else experiencing this?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Welcome to tree city! This week we have flowers on our lovely maple trees. In temperate climates where trees drop their leaves in the winter, it is common for trees to be wind pollinated. This is best accomplished when there are no leaves in the canopy to get in the way. Soon we will have oak and hickory trees spreading their pollen all over. This will take all spring. Get some goooooood allergy medicine.  If you prefer not to live where trees spread their pollen by wind, try the tropics. They use animals there.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Yup. Every year, here and in New York City. For a solid couple of weeks, I have the worst headaches and pain in my sinuses as well as total exhaustion. 24-hour Benadryl before bed helps a little, but it also makes me super sleepy all day.

post,Housing,positive,Hi! I'm an incoming freshman at the University of Michigan. I'm interested in applying to MLC's. Can anybody pls suggest me which MLC's do I apply to? Since we can only apply to 2 of them...I'm thinking of applying to a)a more selective MLC B) a relatively easier MLC. Kindly guide me on the same ! Also, is it worth applying to RC's?  Thank you very much.  Edit: I plan on majoring in computer science at LSA with a minor/double major in econ. Interests: anything related to stem, research etc
comment,Housing,positive,No one can make helpful recommendations on MLCs if you don‚Äôt share what your interests are.   WISE is a great MLC, but I can‚Äôt recommend it if you‚Äôre a man majoring in English.   You should apply to the RC if you‚Äôre interested in participating in the Residential College.
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôm in WISE RP right now, so feel free to pm me!
comment,Housing,positive,RC is doable with stem (math & astrophysics majors for me); I've mapped out the whole way out and it works easily. But, you have to take language, and if you are starting from the beginning, you will have to take 20 credits of RC Language (8 cr intensive I, 8 cr intensive II, 4 cr readings). Least you could possibly take is 4 if you are already up to proficiency in the language. If you are not interested in taking language, you probably shouldn't do it. I personally love it and the people I've met in it so far. The professors and students are great and the space is wonderful.
comment,Housing,positive,MRADS is recommended if you're looking for a more research-oriented environment, but you can also just do UROP if you'd like to do a different MLC like RC, but still do research at the same time. RC is real nice, I have a friend who did RC and she loved it. I did HSSP my freshman year and returned as a peer mentor for sophomore year, but HSSP is more for pre-health kids but honestly, anyone can join as long as you're interested in healthcare. WISE stands for Women in Science and Engineering so that spells it out for you. There's also the Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts, and as the name suggests, ppl who are typically interested into writing and the arts join, but not everyone majors in English and the arts in Lloyd Scholars, there are plenty of STEM majors so idk if that may be of interest to you

post,Housing,positive,Hello guys! I posted an FB post on UMich Housing. This one person, Scott Warren, reached out to me. From the minimal FB profile I got from him, he clearly does not seem like a student and he also doesn't seem active. I am unfamiliar with the AA area and I also feel a bit uneasy from accepting a housing contract without knowing anyone. Has anyone rented from Scott Warren? And if you have, what was your experience with him as a landlord?
comment,Housing,neutral,I would check with Student Legal Services to see if they could provide any advice on renters rights and standard leases in Ann Arbor, even though you‚Äôre an incoming student (not a current one).   If you have a solid lease to protect you and you know your rights, one landlord shouldn‚Äôt be able to wreak too much havoc on your life.
comment,Housing,positive,Ask to see the unit in person. If they‚Äôre a scammer, they‚Äôll make up excuses as to why you cannot see it. If they allow you to see it, bring someone with or have people know your location to be safe.
post,Finances,negative,I just met with a CSE advisor who told me that if I declare this semester, then I‚Äôll be charged retroactively. So I was looking into the tuition difference and noticed that there‚Äôs only an upper division CS-LSA tuition, but not a lower division one. I guess that makes sense in terms of amount of credits one would have by the time they declare, but I was wondering if I‚Äôd still be charged that upper division CS-LSA tuition even though I paid the LSA-lower division tuition for this semester. If anyone‚Äôs been in the same situation as me or happens to know more about this, please let me know!
comment,Finances,negative,There's seems to be some debate about whether or not you're suppose to get charged retroactively, but if you are retroactively charged this semester then I would assume that you're charged the engineering lower division tuition. CS-LSA students are bumped up to engineering tuition when they declare.  Also, are you sure it's a good idea to declare since you're still considered lower division? You should complete EECS 183, 280, 281, 370 and 376 before you declare.
post,Employment,positive,I‚Äôm at the last straw with my on-campus supervisor. I know we only have like a month left, but I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I can‚Äôt exactly afford to quit without that income, though. I‚Äôm going to have a hard time because I‚Äôm leaving Ann Arbor at the end of April like many of you. However, I have hope because two of my coworkers have quit in the last couple of weeks, so they must have found something. At this point, I‚Äôll take anything else, but I don‚Äôt have a car, so it has to be close or remote. Anyone work somewhere where they‚Äôre desperate for new people, or just know a place where they‚Äôd hire someone leaving so soon? I‚Äôd be able to come back to the job in the fall. Thanks!

comment,Media,positive,Some of you might remember a few months ago I [shared photos of my Lego version of central campus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/jrld2s/lego_model_of_um_central_campus_diag_30000_pieces/) That got the attention of the Alumni Association, who commissioned me to build a few things for display in their newly renovated building on campus.   I built a small version of The Cube (Endover) on central campus and also a football helmet that they plan to display alongside a real one. The Cube itself is pretty small, about 4 inches on each side. The base is about 10 inches. The other sides of the base also have text; they say The Victors, Michigan, and Go Blue.  The helmet I built a few years ago but I made some small updates and added a facemask so that it looks more similar to the real thing.  For anyone curious there is an axle piece that runs through the center, it is secured to the inner walls of the cube. On the bottom of the base I have a tile that the whole thing sits on. So actually the entire cube/axle is spinning as a single unit, rather than the cube spinning around the secured axle. I experimented with maybe 10 different versions of this and found that to be the way to get the smoothest spinning motion.   Once things are back to normal on campus if you see it in the Alumni Association building don't forget to give it a spin!

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi! I was recently admitted to the stamps school of art and design at university of Michigan- Ann harbor.   Considering it‚Äôs my top choice I‚Äôm worried and wondering about couple things.   I want to be a ux/ui/graphic designer in the future. However, I heard and read many reviews that stamps is not a good school for design because of their ‚Äúfailed‚Äù interdisciplinary program. I do really want to attend this school but that part stuck out to me and worried me. So I do wonder if you guys know any successful people who made out to be a good designer out of school.   Because of the issue I also want to know how easy or hard it is to dual degree at the school of information for a user design/ ux based study. Do I apply while I am involved in stamps?   Besides these I would be happy to know any general experiences or tips you have for stamps students.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Personally I think those critiques of the program are correct.  The school of information has a focus in User Experience Design (UX).  So I think that show cases it right there, your interest area isn‚Äôt even in the school you‚Äôd be enrolling in.  The BSI has become more competitive over the years, so i wouldn‚Äôt put all your eggs in the basket of transferring into the program/later becoming a dual if you have acceptances in other places.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Hi did you apply EA or RD?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,the BSI is pretty competitive to get into nowadays, but work level wise I think it‚Äôs definitely doable to dual degree with the two or maybe even do some sort of stamps minor if possible.   One thing to keep in mind is that ux is a very broad term and product design is different from ui design, although the two go hand in hand! (also just in general so many things fall under ux ‚Äî interaction design, user research, onwards and upwards) and the BSI will train you in the theory behind ux and learning to code is a pretty significant part of the curriculum (to get in and graduate you will probably be taking at least two python classes and html/css class).   I don‚Äôt know the stamps curriculum so I can‚Äôt speak to it, but I am pretty sure stamps will not make you code. I think SI prepares you reasonably well for a very wide range of tech jobs (consulting, tech consulting, ux design, data analyst, etc) which can be a good place to start from if you know you want to work with design and tech but maybe aren‚Äôt exactly sure what you‚Äôd want your career to be.
post,Class,positive,Hello!  I‚Äôm taking an EECS Course this semester, and I‚Äôm curious how other students utilize CAEN. Whenever I do a project, I make a private Github repo, and utilize that to sync to and run on CAEN. Unfortunately, everyone I want to edit a file, that means I have to push to and then pull from git on the CAEN server which inadvertently makes me log into GitHub. While inconsequential, it is definitely annoying, and I‚Äôd love to hear how you all deal with syncing to CAEN and if there‚Äôre some better methods out there.  Thanks in advance!
comment,Class,neutral,Look into [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).  If you use VS-Code, you can connect to any virtual machine (Caen included) remotely and edit it using VS-Code as opposed to using the process you described.
comment,Class,neutral,If you setup an ssh key for github on CAEN (takes a little time but only the first time) you never have to log in manually again as long as you don't delete your key

comment,Class,positive,Depending on what you use on your personal device, there are SSHFS clients that allow you to mount a remote filesystem over ssh.  I use it from my Fedora system all the time.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Does anyone have insight about living in these two cities? I'm choosing between two schools for graduate school: University of Michigan and University of Minnesota.  I graduated from UC Berkeley and from what some peers who went to UMich have told me, the Ann Arbor vibe is similar to Berkeley's. I loved my undergrad experience, and I'm thinking whether I'd want to be in similar environment.  Anyone who's been to both cities or attended the schools -- I would appreciate your input! Thank you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I didn't go to the University of Minnesota, but I lived in Minneapolis for a little bit. There's definitely similarities between the general vibe of AA and Dinkytown (area around U-Minnesota in Minneapolis). Both feel very much like being on a large college campus.  I guess the main difference I can think of (in terms of geographic location) is that with U-Minn, you'd have access to much more than just a college town. You'd basically be living in Minneapolis. Ann Arbor, on the other hand, is largely UMich and definitely a much smaller city overall.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I attended UMich, and spent a few hours around the UMinn campus while living in Minneapolis, so I can give a limited comparison. I've never been to Berkeley, but my impression of it is that it's much more similar to UMich than to UMinn.  There are some similarities between the two U of M's, like some similar looking architecture, facilities, and similar sized student population. But UMinn's campus to me felt like a small oasis constrained in a fairly run down industrial area, and quite separate from the cities around it. The Mississippi River bounds the campus on one side, so right off the bat that cuts off about 180¬∞ of surrounding land. Then you've got major interstate expressways about a quarter mile to either side of campus, and about 20 lanes of railroad tracks a few blocks to the north running parallel to the river. Beyond the tracks is a very industrial area...warehouses, chemical, and manufacturing facilities. There are a few restaurants and other retail businesses within that constrained area near campus, and there are some residential neighborhoods nearby, but it seems like the area relies more on large 4- to 8- story apartment buildings east of campus to house that many students in that small an area. While you can cross bridges to get to Minneapolis, downtown is like a couple miles away, so it's there but seems like more than a casual stroll.   That's all extremely different from UMich. UMich's central campus is extremely woven into the city of Ann Arbor, with retail businesses immediately surrounding the campus in most directions, and the business district to the northwest flows into the main downtown area about a half mile away, while in other directions they quickly give way to residential neighborhoods with houses or generally small apartment buildings. There are some 10-12 story residential buildings within the business areas right next to campus and downtown, but a lot of students rent houses as well. Expressways ring the city of Ann Arbor, but are like 2 miles from campus, so you aren't generally aware of them near campus. Warehouses and industrial parks are also about that far away...there used to be warehouses in or near downtown, but I think they've mostly been repurposed or replaced.  UMich's north campus, which houses the engineering, art, architecture, and music schools is separated from central campus, so that could be important if that covers your field of study. There are frequent short shuttle buses between central and north campus, but north campus is more isolated from the city, and from retail locations and residential neighborhoods in most directions. There are a few restaurants on north campus in university buildings, and a strip of businesses along a busy street to the north of campus, but it's not like central campus' integration with the city.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I go here but I‚Äôve lived near the UofMN for most of my life. Ann Arbor is definitely a ‚Äòcollege town‚Äô vibe whereas Dinkytown (mn) is definitely like a ‚Äòcollege city‚Äô vibe. Not sure what more you really want but feel free to msg me with more questions either publicly or privately
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,If that is a consideration, Minneapolis winters are usually quite a bit colder than Ann Arbor.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Minneapolis is a lot colder in the winter (no lake effect). Ann Arbor is know for UofM while Minneapolis is known for being a midsized city on the Mississippi. Minneapolis has a lot more crime and much more social problems than Ann Arbor (homelessness, drug use, rule of law). The outlook for A2 is a lot better than Minneapolis at the moment. I heard Target is moving from downtown, and the city is getting less fiscally stable.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Thank you all for your input! Still a hard decision, but these responses help :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm having the same exact dilemma right now. Both programs are amazing so it's really coming down to the cities.
post,Class,positive,I have 2 stem classes in LSA and averages on nearly every single assignment but homework has had a failing average. Almost every in-class quiz has an average of like 4 or 5 out of 10, one midterm had an average of 58% (when it's normally like >75%). The standard deviation on said midterm was a 20 (with 100+ students). I guess you can curve that, but that doesn't feel like a fair assessment if the distribution is that skewed.   I just have literally no idea how I'm doing because everyone is failing together. When a professor was asked in class "how can we do better on quizzes" he deadass just said "I don't know" because he didn't make the quizzes and doesn't really teach to them.   I know everyone's having a bad time in covid but just wanted to know if other students' classes were going about like this? I know I'm only a freshman, but it felt like last sem and summer I could really easily gauge how well I was doing in classes and know my grade accurately.   Sorry for complaining so much to this sub, I feel like I'm the resident bitchy freshman lmao
comment,Class,neutral,Yeah no, that‚Äôs a class or teacher-specific problem. I know how I‚Äôm doing on my classes, and none of them are needing to be curved more than 10 percent.

comment,Class,positive,I can get a rough estimate I guess. I bombed midterm 1 but did well in midterm 2 in Math 214 but I have no clue if either are curved and only 1/3 projects are graded so far.  EECS183 has been good with grading though

comment,Sports,negative,Yea the games have been incredible this year and the CBS March Madness theme is all that‚Äôs been playing in my head.
comment,Sports,negative,Partially March madness but mostly my brain has just quit on me.  I need a break so bad, and no a one day wellness break won‚Äôt cut it.

post,New Student,positive,Hi all,  I'm starting as an engineering freshman this fall and I was just wondering if anyone has had experience with any of the Engineering Scholarships of Honor. What's the typical amount and and who usually gets them? How rare/competitive are they? I tried to find info on the website but they're pretty vague about it. Thanks!
comment,New Student,positive,Current OOS junior in IOE - I‚Äôm a recipient of the engineering scholarship of honor which is renewable for up to 8 full time semesters (4 years). I believe it completely merit based and is granted during the month of March as the high school student is considering selecting Michigan COE as a potential option. I personally don‚Äôt really know many other recipients, so it‚Äôs somewhat uncommon (maybe 5% of an incoming COE class) receive it if I were to guess?  If you‚Äôre an OOS student, you receive $20,000 dollars per year (10k split per academic semester). I don‚Äôt recall the in state equivalent, but it‚Äôs lower to account for the lower instate tuition. There is a GPA requirement, but the scholarship office is generally lenient on it if you‚Äôre in a ball park of it (within .2 gpa). FYI, when you actually receive the scholarship, it falls under a donor/alumni name in recognition of their contribution to the university.   If you receive it, consider yourself really lucky (and well deserved)!! If I didn‚Äôt receive the scholarship, I wouldn‚Äôt have enrolled into Michigan and went to a NYC public college instead. I‚Äôm really grateful for it and for the opportunities it has enable for me to come to UofM!
post,Miscellaneous,positive,As we can see, Michigan weather has hit approximately 60 degrees. It is a nice time to go outside for a jog in shirts and shorts, playing intramural sports(via following COVID guidelines), and seeing the squirrels roam around campus. The crisp, fresh air has encouraged me to take a break from Zoom University and look at nature‚Äôs wonder. If I was in A2, I would jog with content to see the Clock Tower, the Big House, the Dude, and of course the iconic Cube I see all the time on social media. This weather brings euphoric feelings to me as I wish that I can spin the Cube as fast as I can. In short, enjoy the outdoor activities with caution in Ann Arbor before the Michigan weather could decide to snow again.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Yes, spring time here is quite nice. Cheers!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Thanks for the callout!
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello everyone i just got admitted to some grad schools and i can't  decide which one to go... I have UCB Meng in ME(aerospace  concentration), Cornell MS ME, Imperial College MS aerospace engr, UMich  MS aerospace engr, and Columbia MS ME... These 5 are my final round  choices.  Since i study aerospace engr in my undergrad at Purdue, i don't want  to switch to ME if possible. So speaking of aerospace engineering first,  it looks like UCB is a better choice comparing to Umich and Imperial.  However, UCB only offers a Meng program and no MS this year(sad). I  wonder if it is still obviously better than the other MS programs. And  Imperial's MS is also 1 year. I heard people saying something bad about  it.. Umich i think is similar but overall better than Purdue, which has been one of my dream school. Its aerospace is def top5 in US.  Also, Cornell and Columbia are Ivy schools and are strong at ME(which  i don't know much at least for now...i just talked to some students in  these two). But they don't offer aerospace stuff and i find that a lot  of people get admitted which makes it looks a little...  Thank you for reading this i really appreciate any kind of help/advice!! Thanks.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I don‚Äôt think that asking us which school to go to is a viable option since I do not think that there are people who went to the listed programs in this subReddit. If I were you, I would do some research to narrow down your college where you best fit. Either way, you are getting a great education nonetheless.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Figure it out for yourself, supergenius.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,All of them are good choices. Go with the one that gives you least debt. Berkeley is probably the most expensive including cost of living.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Michigan‚Äôs aerospace program is far better than all of those other schools, so if you‚Äôre only concerned with the quality of an aerospace education, then Michigan is the answer. If you don‚Äôt want ME then don‚Äôt even consider the ME programs.
post,COVID-19,positive,I‚Äôm planning on visiting overnight (this is my first time on campus this year - am also vaccinated) and was hoping to get a workout in at the IMSB, and was accordingly wondering how long it takes for the website to go green after your test (if for example I get tested at 10am tomorrow would I be good to workout at noon?). Thanks.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,It takes a couple hours usually. Results come in 48hrs but app shows test completed and you can go into buildings after 2ish hours.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I've had mixed results.  I would say my app has usually updated within 2-5 hours of testing.  Hopefully you will be good, but I'd allow for a larger buffer period in the future, just to be safe.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Just got an admit for MS in ECE with a focus in Robotics and I was wondering how different it is from an MS in Robotics: job-wise, course-wise and just all around. Would I still get the same opportunities as someone in the MS Robotics course in terms of clubs, facilities, etc.  The problem I found is on the website for area wise courses for ECE the robotics section had very few major courses (M and E) for the Robotics (RO) section. Is that what I have to choose from or is there a bigger list of options for it. Also how easy/difficult is it to switch the focus area after joining?  [https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/graduate-course-list/](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/graduate-course-list/) (where I got the course list from)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I can only comment from the sidelines, but I believe the MS Robotics degree will likely have more mechanical/CS work than the ECE specialization. That being said, if you'd like to hear more about it and figure out why there are so few courses that can count (I've noticed that before myself) then I recommend reaching out to whoever the professor in charge of that specialization.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The robotics community in CoE is very open to students of both departments (and students interested in robotics in general). A lot of clubs, facilities, and recruiting happen through the robotics institute but are available to anyone by signing up for their listservs and the slack community.   I know at one point prof. Grizzle used to have a comparison on his website of the two programs but I can‚Äôt find it right now.   I did the MS from the Robotics institute and it was great. I can‚Äôt really talk to how it compares to ECE Robotics but some requirements are different.
post,Meta,negative,I'm usually one who thinks that polarizing people isn't OK, but I've come to see that, people calling this  pandemic things like the "China virus" or "Kung Flu" or dumb shit like that, they aren't trying to be "technically correct". They are trying to make a political and / or racial statement. They are promoting harm towards any person who looks remotely like they are from the place where this pandemic happened to originate. They are literally perpetuating the [rise in Asian hate crimes we are seeing.](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/verify-data-show-asian-hate-crimes-rising-during-covid-pandemic/507-ee3f615f-14b2-49dc-b3e6-a28e5a5cbac1)   We are seeing a lot of people who are blaming the unspeakable evil we saw in Georgia on just an incel mindset. Yeah then why did he make such an effort to target businesses that happened to be Asian owned? It was racially based too.  &#x200B;  I'm tired of seeing every Covid thread that pops up get polluted by some asshat spreading the notion that this virus is the result of a nation, because you're putting that blame on it's people, your putting all of the anger that should be aimed at incredibly corrupt, incompetent, greed-driven governments, at the feet of people just trying to live their lives. This is your explanation. If you keep calling it some stupid joke name, you are trying to perpetuate hate.  &#x200B;  Let's, as a community take a step to state that we will not condone this pushing of blame on equally powerless and blameless people.  &#x200B;  Thank you.
comment,Meta,positive,Contrary to what it feels like (for me) sometimes, I/other mods are not on here 24/7 but there are a pretty good number of banned users or recently removed comments for exactly this reason. Folks are generally responsible with the report button and we respond if it hadn't already been seen. In most cases they are random trolls or new accounts that have no sustained Reddit history or involvement with the subreddit.
comment,Meta,negative,>the notion that this virus is the result of a nation, because you're putting that blame on it's people  It's fine to ban people for inflammatory rhetoric, as is commonly done, as long as you differentiate between the kind of racist propaganda promoted by American leaders, and factual analysis that naturally involve geography and cultural factors. There is plausible evidence that the coronavirus originated in China, and much weaker circumstantial evidence that a market with wild animals may have led to the virus spreading from animals to humans. Personally I don't see those as culpable criticisms, if the virus evolved naturally. Whether it's of Italian, Chinese, or American origin doesn't make much of a difference, other than to identify wild reservoirs and learn more about its lineage.
comment,Meta,negative,This reminds me of the astroturfing/brigading problem we had about 6 months back ‚Äî random throwaway accounts appearing out of the woodworks making wild and hostile anti-union statements and manipulating post karma.   If you see any posts perpetuating racism or misinformation, the single best thing you can do is report them so the mods of the subreddit can ban those users. Do not reply, engage, or otherwise acknowledge their posts - they are trying to get a rise out of people, and responding angrily gives them that satisfaction.  Downvote and report them.
comment,Meta,positive,There is nothing inherently racist with naming a virus after the region it comes from. We have done it lots in the past: lyme disease, ebola, legionnaires disease, spanish flu, west nile, zika. None of which was widely considered a racist act. Sure people who do not like China are calling it the China virus as a means to demean. But you can't just blanket ban all non-covid terms for the virus. One could call it the Wuhan virus and not have any vitriol towards China.  Also even Barack Obama said the Atlanta shooter's motives aren't clear and the director of the FBI is also not sure the shooting is racially motivated.   > Yeah then why did he make such an effort to target businesses that happened to be Asian owned?  The locations were classic rub and tug places, of which the shooter is believed to have frequented. You can find reviews online of the places (well before the shooting) that convey these places were engaging in sex work. Many locals also confirmed the nature of the locations.
post,Degree,positive,just got accepted into ross !! I hear a lot of people dual degree bba and CS but im not sure if i want to do that. My future career goals are all over the place but i do know i want to create my own businesses. Would it be a good idea to dual degree bba and cs? what if i just pursued one degree in bba and took cs classes on the side? I think my main motivation for considering this is the honors lsa program which sounds pretty neat! Would i be super freakin busy pursuing dual degree and honors program? i also heard that if my credits exceed a certain point, i would have to pay more tuition? Im out of state and low income so that might be a pretty big issue. does anyone have any advice/thoughts on this?
comment,Degree,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Degree,positive,Hello! I'm currently a sophomore (doing CS though COE, but there isn't a big difference). My biggest take away is that you'll gravitate towards one of the majors and spend most of your time on it. For me, I didn't join any of the consulting clubs but instead have a teaching position for one of the CS classes here and my internship is CS related. I'm really happy with what I'm going but don't really feel like a Ross Student if that makes any sense. Only do CS if you think you'll like it. It's one of the most demanding and difficult majors here so you'll have to put in the time to make it work
comment,Degree,neutral,I‚Äôd suggest doing a Ross major/CS minor or CS major/applying for a Ross minor

comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Don't really have an attention span to read anything during covid, but damn I read that from start to finish and I'm glad.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Hey I‚Äôve read some of his blogs before! They are ready good! My two top favorite articles by Scott are ‚ÄúI can tolerate anything except my outgroup‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeak men are superpowers‚Äù.  (1) - https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/I-Can-Tolerate-Anything-Except-The-Outgroup  (2) - https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Weak-Men-Are-Superweapons
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Scott Alexander is excellent - from what I understand, he's written for and is popular within the Rationalism community online. Professor Wes Weimer had once posted a link from *LessWrong,* which was where I had first heard about the community. I find that their [weekly COVID updates](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/82kxkCdHeSb8smZZq/covid-3-18-an-expected-quantity-of-blood-clots) are one of the *sanest* sources to read about the pandemic.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I read all of this, and it's great! Thanks for the suggestion :)
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,There's also this idea of threshold intelligence that I found reassuring. Malcolm Gladwell wrote about it in Outliers ([excerpt](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/outliers/chapter-3-the-trouble-with-geniuses-part-1#:~:text=A%20high%20IQ%20does%20generally,words%2C%20IQ%20has%20a%20threshold.)). Basically, if you're smart enough to get through college, you're not really any more or less likely than someone with a higher IQ to be super successful. Other factors matter more at that point.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,This read as pretty depressing to me, how are you guys interpreting it?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thanks for this read! As someone debating coming to U of M (I was accepted for Fall 2021 Transfer!), I find myself with the all too familiar impostor syndrome and the thoughts around that that this blog brings up.  I‚Äôm a veteran returning to school and I worry about if I‚Äôm smart enough or if I have the capability. And what does that say about me? Am I somehow lesser because I fucked up in high school and had to have a ‚Äúreset‚Äù of sorts through the military? Can I handle the transition from my local community college to the rigor that is at U of M?  Am I smart enough? I feel like I have to be if I want to be successful. Neither of my parents went to university.  It‚Äôs a good article. Definitely helps give some perspective on the whole thing.

post,Health / Wellness,positive,All of this effort I took to keep up with my school work this whole semester, constantly working for way longer than I probably should have due to ADHD like symptoms .  . . coffee / theramine might help, I plan to try it tomorrow but, right now, I can't even do this assignment that requires listing things and some simple math. My brain keeps wandering off. Please, please send help. I need to get through this semester.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I definitely relate on the brain bustage going on, and my big silver lining is that there's the whole pass-fail policy thing going on again this semester, which is seriously the only thing getting me through this finals-adjacent chunk of the semester
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Not the same as your situation in regards to ADHD, but I've gotten to the point where trying to focus on school triggers an instant migraine due to overworking, constantly looking at screens, and no break. The only advice I've got is to maybe try break things down into smaller, more manageable tasks. If you feel like your achieving more, it may help boost your mood. Best of luck.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I do not have adhd but I have GAD. Meditation really helps to concentrate. I did it once a day for a month and I am able to focus for long periods of time
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,It‚Äôs not really my place to say if you‚Äôll be fine because I do not know what it‚Äôs like to have ADHD. I would go to CAPS where students can get help for mental health. Also, if a professor allows you to write an admin form, fill it out so your professor knows what is going on.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,so basically i think i might have to withdraw from one of my classes. i haven‚Äôt been doing so well due to personal circumstances and i feel like i‚Äôm not understanding the material enough. i was thinking of withdrawing from the class and taking it in the spring semester (it would be my only class, so it would be easier to focus on). however, i do know that Ws will appear on my unofficial transcript. i do want to transfer to SPH starting next year, but I‚Äôm afraid of how this will look on my application? any advice would be greatly appreciated, i need some guidance :/
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,You‚Äôre much better off taking the W and improving you‚Äôre grade in the retake in the spring then getting a shit grade now   They‚Äôre really not as big of a deal as you may feel right now. I had a few on my transcript and got into grad school fine. I also think a lot more students may have acquired them in the last academic year due to covid.  Taking the class in the spring will more or less showcase your ability in the class and render the W pointless anyways
post,Finances,negative,Hello all,   I'm a prospective nursing student that wants to attend UofM. Unfortunately though, im out of state (oos), and the costs are p high for out of state students.   My question is to any oos students currently attending UofM (would be even better if you attended school of nuesing), how are finances working out for you? Do you face a lot of debt by going there?   If you cannot/do not want to discuss your financial grounds in the public comments, plz dm me! Bc I really wanna go there, but I want to know how much it'll hurt my pockets.   Thanks
comment,Finances,positive,Nursing is a great profession and the starting salaries are solid, but also not as high as something like engineering. Pay scales are usually quite standard and it often matters more that you have *a BSN* than *a fancy BSN*.  If you go into six figure debt for undergrad, you‚Äôll have a harder time paying for an advanced practice degree (Nurse Practitioner, Nurse Midwife, Nurse Anesthetist, etc.) later if that interests you.   What other schools have you been accepted to? How much less would those BSNs cost you?  Large amounts of student debt can certainly be paid down, but they limit your life choices in your twenties. Like when you buy a home or how nice of a place you rent, what kind of car you drive, what kind of vacations you take and how often, when and how you get married, when you start a family (if that interests you), etc. I know those are big things to think about at 17 or 18 - the debt loads I was considering at that age felt super abstract.
comment,Finances,neutral,i‚Äôm oos and in dept ü•∞
comment,Finances,neutral,Instead of "debt", say "leverage". It will make you feel kinda better.
comment,Finances,positive,It‚Äôs a really good program You‚Äôll do clinical pretty much immediately and get a ton of experience through that. In addition to the UMich hospital, the VA and St Joe‚Äôs are in Ann Arbor so you could end up at any of the three.  Pretty much anyone I know who did the program who didn‚Äôt do more schooling right away secured a nursing job in their target city for over 65k a year post graduation, with most of them earning more.  So yes it‚Äôs a costly education but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have any issues paying it down
comment,Finances,positive,I‚Äôm an oos nursing student & i‚Äôll be in ~20k debt by graduation. But it‚Äôs honestly because I haven‚Äôt paid anything to the school directly yet; I could have paid like 6k a year and have no debt. I got a pretty generous scholarship from the school, which made it affordable. I heard about the scholarship after my acceptance around late March/April-ish but before the decision deadline (if I can remember correctly), and you don‚Äôt apply to it separately. However, I only know 3 (including myself) people in my class who got this scholarship, so I don‚Äôt know if you rely on it. Nursing is a great profession to make a lot of money post-grad & honestly even starting your summer after sophomore year if you start working as a nurse tech/aid. UofM is pretty pricey though, and I see a lot of great nurses who didn‚Äôt necessarily attend a 4yr prestigious university. But if you wanted to get into research or other things, the name value can be helpful.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey guys. I got accepted to Umich Dearborn recently as an international student, I haven‚Äôt heard back from AA yet. I was wondering if it‚Äôs easier to transfer to AA after the first year at Dearborn or is it the same as any other uni? Also can anyone tell me what the science department is like in Dearborn?
post,Miscellaneous,positive,I have been at home for a long time. I graduated from community college and transferred to Umich this semester. After President Schlissel announced in-person classes, I am more than excited to go to Ann Arbor to meet lifelong friends that I made at Zoom University and check out sporting events which I missed out on during my freshman year. I am concerned about getting the swing into things after staring at a monitor for several months, but hopefully that uncertainty will go away. I look forward to calling A2 my home away from home. Also, this Reddit community is awesome since you guys have helped me understand much more about Reddit and U-M. I am proud to be a Wolverine knowing that I have the support from every Wolverines.

comment,Class,positive,I had the same problem with that project when I took the class. It basically seems like intuition is your best bet because I struggled to find any useful wireshark info online. Granted I didnt do very well on that part of the project so it may not be the best coming from me

comment,Class,positive,mans really signed his piazza reply like an email
comment,Class,positive,lmao i cant believe it was John Wolfe with that reply.... he's one of the nicest profs out there
comment,Class,negative,Had Dr. Wolfe for orgo way back in the day. People had the same complaint about exams back then and he had the same response. Consistent.   As a physician who is very detail oriented and micro manages everything, where even small mistakes can cause harm, he's not wrong.   I don't know if I would use his *specific* analogy (removing the wrong organ is not a small detail), but on other things in medicine where getting a dose wrong (I mean being off by one digit because you typed/wrote it wrong) can cause harm (seen it happen), partial credit isn't a thing.  His point is that orgo isn't about rote memorization. If you forgot an arrow here or a carbon there, you're just using memory to get the correct answer and your memory was just off. If you truly understood the concept well, it would not have been missed.
comment,Class,neutral,That‚Äôs so extra and unnecessaryüòÇ
comment,Class,neutral,That seems like a pretty unfair analogy lol. Freshman level orgo class isn‚Äôt life or death.

comment,Class,neutral,Do surgeons really worry about arrows in their undergraduate orgo class? Seams like a jump.
comment,Class,positive,This has been the policy since I took orgo at Michigan (04).  Details matter. Better to learn in freshman year than when the stakes are actually higher.
comment,Class,negative,It's a ridiculous analogy. By extension, if you got one question wrong, shouldn't you get a zero on the whole exam? If you bombed one exam shouldn't you fail the whole class? Sith, absolutes, etc.
comment,Class,positive,Some fields require perfection. If you can‚Äôt handle the heat then get out of the kitchen.
comment,Class,neutral,Wolfe struck me a a dick when I took 210 as well. I remember drawing a chair conformation in a way not typical, I overexagerated the directions each group would be pointing so instead of slightly up or down they were super up or down. That got 0 points, and all the other questions that followed (all of which I got correct) were also marked incorrect because they insist on the model drawn, which was 'technically incorrect'. They do grade that class very strictly. I asked Wolfe if I could get it regraded and he took away more points from an unrelated question.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey guys recently got into UM LSA data science program.

post,Degree,positive,title. my roommate is pursuing a dual degree with school of info and ross, and was wondering if anyone had to go through similar thought processes of choosing a "home school" from one of them!  Thanks,
comment,Degree,neutral,I dual between Engineering and LSA. I forget when, but I did have to choose a home school on some form in the dual degree application process. I just chose engineering as that's the school I was in initially and is the school for what I consider is my "primary" major.    I honestly haven't noticed what choosing a home school really does. You pay tuition based on your more expensive major. But you can reap the benefits of both: access to both school's resources/programs/advisors, you get both degrees, ~~I can say I'm in engineering for the add/drop deadline since that's later~~. But idk if there's anything different for Ross/SI
comment,Degree,positive,I would ask your academic advisor. I‚Äôm a dual degree with SI and LSA, and it didn‚Äôt really matter which one I picked as my home school since SI is an upper level program and I‚Äôm an upperclassman in LSA, but this could be different for Ross & SI. Just to be sure, as your academic advisor
post,Housing,positive,Hello, I know there have been a bunch of posts about housing recently (feel free to take this down), but what does the process of signing up for housing for returning students (for the fall) actually look like? I know the application is opening up next week, but is this application similar to the one from freshman year? I read about being assigned times to select dorms, and that you could select specific rooms as well. Does all of this start next week with the same aforementioned application?  Confused freshman here, thanks for entertaining my many questions!
comment,Housing,neutral,Based on the message on the housing website, they might have changed it, since they mention assignments going out in the summer.  Maybe we won't get to pick this year?
comment,Housing,positive,Someone else noted that it may be different this year, so not that. But normally it‚Äôs not like freshman year at all, you pick a specific room based on what‚Äôs available when you go to sign up.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Do you guys have any advice on whether it would be a better idea to minor in Applied Statistics or just take more Upper-Level CS courses? I am a CS major and am in conflict, since I am interested in both, and both seem really useful. It's just that there are so many ULCS courses that interest me, but I'll only be able to take 4 if I minor in stats. At the same time, I feel like diversifying my skills by taking stats is more useful.  I asked my advisor and they basically said "Do what you want." What would you guys recommend?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,You should specify your goal such as career job perspectives and other details before getting more recommendations or feedbacks. It is really hard to determine what is useful without that info. E.g A front end developer (web design and etc) may never use statistics significantly.  And you won‚Äôt be able to learn any Complementary knowledge in statistics. It is thus not meaningful to diversify skills in this way.   To convince you about this point further, let‚Äôs look at what the minor in applied statistics is composed of.   Other than Calc and Stats 250, which should be already required in CS, you need Stats 306, 401 as core courses.   Stats 306 is a class about data visualization in R(ggplot 2 and tidyverse) + funcs and loops. It prepares students to read documents in R on their own. Visualization might be useful but I doubt if a Cs student is unable to self-study them in Python in 2-3 weeks via some online tutorial.   Stats 401 is a non-mathematical regression class. I‚Äôd say that unless you are going for Phd (e.g Econ phd utilizes OLS all over the place in research papers) , most career jobs do not require regression methods beyond what taught in EECS 445. Btw, 445 is more mathematically rigorous than 401.   Then, you need two upper statistic electives. Stats 403 is a very intro survey class and if you are not going for social science Phd or related government jobs, you won‚Äôt need any of those knowledge, so do Stats 470 and 480.   Other popular options are Stats 406,415,449. I‚Äôve not taken 449 and thus not being able to comment it.   For stats 406, it is a bunch of hypothesis testing with Monte Carlo Methods + peripheral ML. For stats 415, it is statistical Ml with an eye toward data analysis and be aware that this class does not teach about neural network. Those two classes could be useful if you incline towards somewhat data scientists positions.   I‚Äôve also taken Stats 526 (note that there is an easier version(Stats 430)) and both of these two could satisfy the elective requirements. They might be useful if you want to specialize deep learning and have a solid foundation of math in advance. Note that you could do EECS 501,502 in Cs dept and they are more useful and specifically designed for CS students, but definitely, you won‚Äôt be able to get a minor anymore.   I‚Äôve also heard that some students take 506,507 as undergrads electives. But not very useful from my opinion, if given Cs backgrounds.   To sum up, you should specify your goal first and then ask advisors for what statistical knowledge might be complementary in this field or meaningful to diversify skills. There are really so much concepts that no one is able to grasp all of them or worth your efforts to learn.

post,Class,positive,How often do eecs 183 honor codes come up, it‚Äôs an intro class, seems like all the code should be the same. Also does the council let you know right away or at the end of the semester?
comment,Class,positive,Council let's you know pretty much right after the prof submits the report. But the prof might not submit the report until the end of the semester.
comment,Class,positive,It's pretty common, not 280 level but they still happen. Code will obviously look similar so they don't usually code unless it's obvious that you copied from someone (usually a moss score > 30)
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello all! I‚Äôm very happy to say I was recently accepted as an LSA Transfer Student for Fall 2021. I have a couple questions that I was hoping current students could fill me in on before I start thinking about enrolling.  A bit of my background to start: I‚Äôm a non-trad, first gen student. I‚Äôm 24 and currently active duty military and will basically be getting out in the summer and then moving right in on to school. I‚Äôm really motivated to do well in school because I see it not just as an opportunity for me, but for my family. Neither of my parents went to a four-year uni (community college and trade school).  And so a big thing for me is fitting into campus and campus culture. I‚Äôm older and not super into partying like crazy anymore (trust me, I‚Äôve done plenty of that in the military), and I want to be academically challenged.   What‚Äôs campus culture like for someone who is super passionate about learning and school? I‚Äôve tried informing myself through prospective student stuff and reading the UofM website, but I find it hard and overwhelming a little to navigate what I should be looking out for and I figure it‚Äôs better to ask people who are literally living it. Also, how do older students fit into the student body?  That‚Äôs all that immediately comes to mind. Thanks all for reading.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Honestly Michigan is a tricky place for non traditional students just because so much of the population is traditional right out of high school undergrads   That being said there‚Äôs a huge graduate population so you can definitely make friends that are mid 20s or later you‚Äôre just not necessarily gonna meet them in class  As it‚Äôs a big school you‚Äôll find all types of people but I would say a large amount of students are invested in their education, I think compared to other state schools a lot of people here were in the top percentage of their high school class so that makes the academic environment a bit higher here  I‚Äôd encourage you to the veterans office and tap into resources they have as well as other transfer resources on campus. OAMI could also be a useful office as they have first gen resources
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It is what you make of it and will likely depend on what you study or what activities you participate in.  I can't comment on the LSA specifically as I'm in the CoE where it seems there is a bit less of a party culture, probably because a bunch of us are nerds lol.  But you will find no shortage of individuals who are very academically oriented in any major you choose, you can usually find those kinda people in student groups, clubs, various organizations.  I was/still am in your shoes, got out of the military and started at UofM when I was 26.  I've found UofM to be veteran friendly and there are some good benefits they offer.  There is also a Student Veterans of America club that is great for support, info, social events, etc.  I personally commute to Ann Arbor and don't live on campus, so it has been a bit more challenging to participate in campus culture.  I imagine it will be much easier if you actually live in or around AA.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I went to U of M from 19 to 23 and now I'm back in my 30s with a wife and kid.  I also lived in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti for most of my 20s because I worked for the U. I personally don't care about fitting in. I guess it's part of getting older. I prioritize my studies and my family for the most part, but I do love the culture of Michigan. Also, I'm a sober guy so I don't really "party" anymore. Hit me up if you have any questions.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm pretty sure we all know how competitive UofM Ann Arbor is as a school in general, however I was trying to find an acceptance for their graduate nursing programs and couldn't find any at all. Does anyone know how competitive it is, like specifically and accurately? And is there anything I can do to make myself a competitive candidate?
post,New Student,positive,basically the title lol. i‚Äôm an incoming first-year for fall 2021 and am hoping to join the mmb - will i have time to do both marching band and mrads? i don‚Äôt want to put the time into applying to mrads if i won‚Äôt be able to do it anyway. it seems like a really cool opportunity though, plus i‚Äôm struggling to find a roommate so it‚Äôll solve that problem as well :)  if it makes a difference, i‚Äôll be in COE and am coming in with a lot of dual enrollment credit so i‚Äôm planning on taking a fairly light course load my first semester.  any insight you can share is appreciated!
comment,New Student,positive,I know a good amount of people who did both (it was called MRC back in my day).

post,Miscellaneous,positive,Below is a wonderful email I received this morning!  As an Asian American, I am really happy that my professor feels that it's more worth her time to virtue signal to our entire class as opposed to answering the questions I emailed to her yesterday.  But actually, what was her goal in sending this email? I really don't get it. Actually, the second paragraph seems to accurately summarize exactly what this email is. I am Asian and this email accomplishes nothing but soothing this professor's white guilt while also distracting her from actually answering student questions for the 4 assignments due tonight.  &#x200B;  CLARIFICATION:  I am more annoyed that my prof. decided to spend an hour this morning typing this out as opposed to answering my question which I emailed last night. I frankly don't have that big of an issue with the email itself but instead an issue with the prof. not focusing on actually teaching as this class which has been ridden with ambiguity on assignments that seem to always require clarification.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/360ilm38r0o61.jpg?width=1414&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb5c608045492229067dbfb1a9a99f25ddaff380

comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Chill out lmao
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I think you‚Äôve confused virtue signaling with genuine empathy...
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I get the feeling your attitude is why your professor doesn't write back.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,I don't see how you can be punishing her for expressing empathy, but then criticize white people for not taking action against racism. You cannot have it both ways to fit your narrative; this email was perfectly fine.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,I think the professor answered the questions you asked; the bullet points at the end say exactly what actions they can take for those affected by the shootings and other recent events.  Your clarification acknowledges you're *more* annoyed about the professor not responding to some chemistry-related questions, but that's a separate issue from the criticisms in most of the rest of your post. I think what you wrote is misguided and inappropriate. It's disrespectful to your professor, and dismissive and insensitive to your classmates who may be struggling with emotional and mental health issues. Attributing the professor's motive to soothing "white guilt" sounds racially biased. Just because you don't need any accommodation doesn't mean offering help or support to others "does nothing".  Overall I think your post is shameful.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I've been accepted to get an M.Arch. from Taubman, and I'm trying to weight whether it's financially worth it. I've been awarded $18k/year total in scholarships, aid, and work study, but, that still leaves tens of thousands of dollars left to pay. And I already have $20k in debt from undergrad.  Is an M.Arch. from Taubman worth almost $100,000 in debt?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Do you have other options to earn an advanced degree in architecture? How much do they cost? How strong are those programs‚Äô reputations?  What is your earning potential before the masters in architecture? And afterwards?  ‚Äî-  For example, my starting salary with a BSE was $70K. A MS / MSE would have have caused me to incur a lot of debt and there was the opportunity cost of forgoing two years of salary (I wasn‚Äôt eligible for SUGS, the one year program). My employment prospects with the masters would have been a bit better (and it might have paid off long term) but my starting salary wouldn‚Äôt have gone up by a lot - maybe I could have expected more like $85K. That made it less than worthwhile to incur a bunch of debt, and skip two years of earning a comfortable salary.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I am graduating from the MArch program this year with that much debt Personally for me I‚Äôve felt it‚Äôs worth every penny.   My job offer for post graduation is 35k higher then what I got offered out of a design undergrad
post,Prospective Student,negative,Has anyone received some form of an admissions letter from the undergraduate School of Public Health program? I‚Äôm getting worried because some people have gotten acceptances so does that mean the rejections are sent out after?
post,Sports,positive,Has anyone received a donut from Coach Howard? I saw him giving out donuts to students at the Diag through U-M‚Äôs Men‚Äôs Basketball Instagram account two years ago. It would be cool to meet a basketball legend who loves U-M which is also the college he played for.  Fun fact: He was a part of the Fab 5.

post,Employment,positive,Hey everyone! - I'm a student down at Georgia Tech. Some fellow students and I made a website, called¬†[Canary](https://canarystudent.com/register), to read (and write) anonymous reviews on internships and the interview process. The idea is to help students learn what internships are like at different companies and how to best prepare for them (what classes to take, what interviews are like, etc). Its already grown to over 500 reviews from companies like Tesla, Boeing, Amazon, John Deere, Honeywell, and NCR.  I thought I'd throw it in here since hopefully y'all and other schools could find it useful too! The site is¬†[canarystudent.com](https://canarystudent.com/). We really focused on user privacy as much as we can (your name/email is never displayed with the review or shares with 3rd parties.) Also we're actively developing, so don't hesitate to reach out via DM with suggestions or leave a comment on what you think of the platform.  It'd be awesome to get some experiences/reviews from Michigan students on the site; Would y'all use something like this if it kept growing? Appreciate any feedback - thanks everyone!
comment,Employment,positive,it might be especially useful if you create a separate tab or whatever for just interview-related things. like questions asked, advice, etc.  that‚Äôs something i used glassdoor a lot for and it was really difficult to navigate their site to find the right positions and sift through reviews to find interview-related material
comment,Employment,positive,This is cool, especially since the questions look like they‚Äôd be useful for interns. In case people aren‚Äôt too aware, Glassdoor is kinda sus so you gotta be careful and look for red flags. I know some companies engage in some not so great practices on Glassdoor to protect their reputation, like reporting negative reviews from past employees to remove them and adding fake positive reviews. Some reviews are also unusable because people write trash reviews so they can read other company reviews and what not. Apparently, Glassdoor is not profitable right now too and might be pivoting towards being a PR site where companies can pay them to look better (but this is speculation).  One thing I‚Äôm concerned about on your site is how some reviews seem pretty in-depth where students could get doxxed‚Äîespecially if a given company has a smaller intern program and an intern gives a super detailed review. There should be a way for students to share and see pay, school, major, etc separate from individual reviews like how work and culture rating have averages. I know some sites hide shared information or give wider ranges so people don‚Äôt get doxxed until they get enough in their sample to safely share aggregations too, so that‚Äôs something to consider.  You probably already considered it, but just hoping to help. Good luck!

comment,Employment,neutral,THWg
comment,Employment,positive,I probably wouldn't use this tbh. It gives short yelp style reviews which are pretty unreliable. Also when grouping big companies you have such a diverse amount of potential experiences that the data isn't useful at this granularity. A company like Microsoft has 1000s of different teams each which will have different experience. Also the work/culture rating is way to vague to gather meaningful data in the meta analysis.
post,Miscellaneous,negative,Asian Americans, we should fight for equalities as hard as other minorities do in this country. When will we see signs not only BLM, but also ALM?   Asian lives matter! All lives matter!!
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,See https://mesa.umich.edu/article/apia
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Honestly, this ain‚Äôt it chief.   Fighting against racism, prejudice, and violence against Asian Americans, 100% yes‚Äîit‚Äôs vital now and always has been. But co-opting BLM language and saying ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù, is wrong, very wrong. It benefits none of our fights and actually works against our struggle.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Has central student government organized an event related to the Atlanta hate crime which killed at least 6 Asian women early this week?
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,The motivation for Black Lives Matter is that many people perceive black people as uniquely victimized by violence at the hands of law enforcement.  Whatever other problems various Asian communities may have, this is not normally a problem. Asian-Americans and especially Asian foreign nationals have a much lower rate of criminality and much higher rate of education than the norm for the U.S. - both of these factors leading towards a very low chance of them being shot by the police.

post,Employment,negative,I am a senior majoring in Mathematics. Every summer I go back to my home country to visit family. So I have never looked for/had an internship. This summer I am not able to go home. For the first time I am looking for an internship. I don‚Äôt know if I am late to the game or what the reasons are but I am having a lot of difficulty getting an internship.   I read through other posts and found most students have internships lined up during summer. I am starting to worry that I won‚Äôt be able to get a job after I graduate. Anyone successfully land a job without internships?
comment,Employment,positive,A job in what field? Without previous experience, no one is going to know what industry you‚Äôre aiming for with a degree in math. I can personally attest to people with no internships getting jobs with a degree in physics or math into various industries but they also did research throughout the school year and had some research applications in the field they entered. What‚Äôs your GPA like? Was this a pure math concentration, applied math, etc.? If your GPA was 3.2+ and you interview well, I think you should expect to find a job but it‚Äôs going to depend on what industry you‚Äôre looking at and the pay and job prestige is almost certainly going to be subpar compared to your classmates. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about the latter portion; you can basically decide how long that lasts with job performance, work ethic, etc. As far as your difficulty with internships goes, all I can say is make sure you have people read your resume. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a place at Umich that helps with your resumes. If you provide more specifics I think people would be able to help better.
comment,Employment,positive,You are admittedly very late to the game, if you are looking for a summer 2021 internship (big corporate recruiting happens largely August-November, with the secondary season being about January-February), and being an international student makes it even more challenging.  If you need help with your resume or application/interviewing tips, feel free to reach out.
comment,Employment,negative,A bit unrelated but may I ask how were your upper level math courses compared to 217 in terms of difficulty?
post,Housing,positive,Hi!  I'm an incoming MHSA student with UMich's School of Public Health. I'm coming from California and have never been to the Midwest.

post,Employment,negative,I‚Äôm currently a sophomore, will be a junior next year. I‚Äôm really burnt out and don‚Äôt want to take any summer classes or find a summer internship/research (which I‚Äôd be late at, seeing as it‚Äôs nearly April). I have been taking classes every semester since fall 2019 with multiple different jobs/internships. I‚Äôm just tired.   I‚Äôm looking at going to law school sometime after undergrad. Would not doing anything this summer be looked down upon by law schools? By future employers after undergrad and before law school? I‚Äôve had one internship so far and hope to have another internship next summer. Would it be bad to just chill this summer?
comment,Employment,positive,> I‚Äôm looking at going to law school sometime after undergrad. Would not doing anything this summer be looked down upon by law schools?  I'm currently a law student at another institution. Unless you're planning on attending a T14 school (e.g. Berkeley, Harvard, Yale, Umich), the *only* thing that matters is your LSAT score and GPA. Having a summer gap in your transcript will not matter. If you *are* planning on attending a T14, you should do some sort of intern/externship thing related to law. Again, unless you're looking at a top-tier school, having a "gap" will not matter.  Furthermore, future employers in the field of law are not going to care about your past work experience or lack thereof, unless that work experience was in a legal field. No post-JD employer is going to care about whether or not you tended a bar or worked as a cashier. The only thing that an employer will look at is your law school GPA (and that's only your first employer, after that it's pretty much just past work experience).  I did *absolutely nothing* in my sophomore/junior summer between transferring from community college to UM, and I did *absolutely nothing* the summer after I graduated. You can most likely just chill for the summer.  P.S. - happy to answer any other law/pre-law questions you may have.
comment,Employment,positive,Michigan‚Äôs summer is really long. With a typical twelve week internship, I usually had most of May and August to chill.  I think a resume gap from doing literally nothing could be a little challenging. But also kind of understandable with the pandemic. I would learn towards doing *something* but maybe not the most grueling possible thing.   What about volunteering? Could you find something that‚Äôs not the whole summer and/or less than 40 hours a week? Maybe there‚Äôs something that would be meaningful to your interests for law school, which could help with burn out, and give you something to talk about when you apply for internships for next summer.
comment,Employment,positive,Second community college courses. Puts your summer in the "doing something" column rather than "doing nothing" for your resume's sake, but also makes your future semesters easier. CC colleges are really nice.
comment,Employment,positive,When I was an undergrad I worked in bars and an ice cream shop over the summers, up until summer before senior year (when I did get a real-ass internship). It was always a blast, gave me something to do, a bit of sweatpants money, and wasn‚Äôt stressful. I turned out totally fine, eventually worked in MBB consulting.  If there was ever a time to be good to yourself over the summer, this is it. I promise your lifetime career, happiness, and success are not riding on this summer. Get a fun easy job and otherwise just do you.
comment,Employment,positive,I said the same thing but one week in to summer I wish I had
comment,Employment,neutral,I hear what people are saying, but like... take care of yourself before anything else. Take some time off if you need to. One summer won‚Äôt make or break you (hell it could break you IF you overwork yourself while burnt out), especially after you get a degree from UMich.
comment,Employment,positive,Michigan Law student here who was a Michigan undergrad and went straight through. I didn‚Äôt intern after freshman year. Interned after sophomore year. Didn‚Äôt intern after Junior year while studying for the LSATs. I did a bunch of different campus jobs during my years though and that is the main thing I get asked about now in my Law firm interviews. I just got a Big Law summer position, which is extremely rare for 1Ls, and I‚Äôm even less qualified professionally than most of my classmates, so I think you‚Äôre more than fine as long as you work on some other things. PM if you have more questions
comment,Employment,positive,hey honestly mental health > packing your summer with stuff imo  If you feel you need to take a break, you should go ahead and do that.  It's so easy to get stuck in a rat-race (I'm guilty of that) esp at a competitive school like UM. To your last question, it's not bad at all to just chill this summer! In fact, it can help you to recharge (since you said you're tired) and gain perspective. Hope this helps, and good luck!  p.s. this is just my opinion, but I don't entirely disagree with others in the comments... maybe try to do something for your resume that is a heck of a lot less stressful that what you would do otherwise :)
comment,Employment,positive,Oh honey no, mental health first. Law schools can‚Äôt review your application if you‚Äôve driven yourself off a wall and couldn‚Äôt apply period. I learned this the hard way; relax, take a breather. It‚Äôs good for you, and you deserve to do so without feeling guilty. If you want to take a class or two that are generally less stress just to make life easier in the future, go for it. But please, if you‚Äôre tired, take a break. There‚Äôs no shame in it and I‚Äôm so proud of you for making it this far.
comment,Employment,positive,My internship after sophomore year fell apart at the last minute. I decided to take some classes spring term. A month or so into summer I got a job at Aventura hosting and bussing. Besides work I went to the gym 5 days a week and tried to appreciate Ann Arbor summer.  I felt disappointed in myself at the time with countless friends interning in cool cities like NY, Sydney, London. In retrospect it didn‚Äôt fucking matter and I‚Äôm proud of the experience I got that summer. I‚Äôve since had a fun career in investment banking and now private equity
comment,Employment,negative,I vote for just relax. We have to fight this work til you die culture.
comment,Employment,positive,Maybe find a part time job and have fun/take care of yourself. Do you have friends on campus you enjoy spending time with? My undergrad summers on campus were some of the best times of my life. Spent most of that doing research in a lab and hanging with friends. Get to the gym, work a little, have fun, maybe do some psychedelics if that is your thing. You won't have an opportunity like this again for the rest of your life.
comment,Employment,positive,Go off! don't do anything this summer. I wish I was thoughtful enough to realize I need a break the way you do
comment,Employment,positive,Hey - currently a Michigan Law student who went straight through from Michigan undergrad.   I didn't have a fancy internship during my second summer, but I did work as a billing clerk in a law firm and waitressed through much of college. I truly do not think that my second summer or waitressing had anything to do with getting into law school. If you're worried about it, take a look at the Michigan in Washington program and see if you can do another internship during your winter semester next year in DC (awesome experience, I cannot recommend it highly enough!). I had two internships on my resume when I applied for law school. By far the most important parts of the application are the LSAT score and GPA, in that order (as Ken\_Knifen said - I cannot highlight this enough). If you're worried about a gap on your resume, find a casual part time job.   Please feel free to reach out if you have any concerns, I'd be happy to help.
comment,Employment,positive,I'd recommend taking at least one community college course. If you're in LSA, I found it great to knock out some easy distribution credits. For transfer credit, they don't look at the letter grade, just wether you passed, so it's been really chill in my experience. I did it last summer when everything got cancelled due to COVID and did not feel overwhelmed at all.
comment,Employment,negative,Don't do *nothing*.  Go find a (relatively) low stress job that earns you some extra cash and doesn't follow you once you punch out. Preferably something that gets you outside. Future you will thank you for the decreased debt load.
comment,Employment,positive,I would strongly recommend doing something
comment,Employment,positive,It is 100% fine and if you are tired just relax. You will be fine and absolutely nobody will mind at all.
comment,Employment,neutral,Unfortunately, if you have your sights set on law school, you'll probably have to figure out something to put on your resume. You kind of need to build your resume beginning sophomore summer to have something to talk about for junior or senior internship roles  Sucks that this is what it has come to in college
post,Social,positive,I'm a freshman right now and I'll probably be staying on campus in the summer. I have a couple of questions -  How many undergrads stay on campus in the summer? How hard will it be to find an undergrad (preferably my year) to room with? I don't know anybody else who is going to be staying on campus in the summer.  Also, how easy is to meet people in the summer? What are some things to do/clubs that run through the summer?  Thanks for the help!
comment,Social,neutral,there are lots of undergrads that stay here for the summer, but it‚Äôs not the majority. i don‚Äôt think it should be hard fo find a sublet.   it‚Äôll probably be a bit difficult to meet new people, especially with covid. most clubs do not continue to run over the summer, but there are exceptions.   i‚Äôll be here over the summer. if you ever want to get ice cream or just chill on the diag, feel free to message me.
comment,Social,positive,if you want a community atmosphere joining a coop for the summer is a great set up!! i subleased one summer and spent one in the coops and it was much more being around people and having that intentional community
comment,Social,neutral,find a sublease!!! so many ppl are trying to sublet places rn in the facebook groups
comment,Social,positive,Hi there! From my experience, a ton of undergraduates stay on campus in the summer. Even if you aren't doing anything necessarily academic/work-related, Ann Arbor has so much to offer in the summer. Some research labs are opening up, which is a great resume experience depending on your major. There's also a ton of part-time summer jobs. You should check out the AADL summer games, I highly recommend it! There are (I think) some clubs that are really active during the summer, like maybe the backpacking or hiking club? Check that out, if you're interested.  &#x200B;  In regards to sublets, there are a ton on FB pages (like I see some comments mentioning). Depending on what's available to sublet, finding someone in your year is kind of hit or miss.   In my experience subletting, I wouldn't necessarily worry about the year of your summer roommate and rather focus on if they'd be a good fit for your personality. Are you a night owl or morning person? How cleanly do you prefer things to be? Will it annoy you to hear someone in your kitchen early in the morning/late at night? What time does the other person shower and will it conflict with your schedule? It may sound silly, but these are the things I would recommend you consider rather than if your roommate is in your year. Realistically, most undergraduates are around the same age anyways. (Kind of shameless plug) I've been considering subleasing my room out, but I'm a bit on the fence because I would prefer someone who would respect my space since I'm returning to my apartment in the fall. PM me if you'd be interested and we can set up a time to get coffee to chat things over! (Offer to get coffee also stands even if you're not interested, I'm an extrovert and online classes are getting to me!)
post,Class,positive,Hi everyone,  Not sure how relevant this is but I'm premed so GPA matters a lot RIP and I took Orgo 1 originally last spring so I could not "pass/NRC" the class. I ended up getting a C+ in it which is passing but I think med schools prefer Bs or above. I'm retaking it this semester and am on track to get an A or A-. I just wanted to double check that this won't affect my GPA at all since it is a repeat and will just be counted as no credit? Has anyone successfully petitioned for their repeat course to be counted (not expecting it to replace my old grade would just like it to help my GPA if I do well)
comment,Class,positive,If you already took orgo and received credit for it, then orgo would be considered a not-for-credit class and a NFC should show up on your transcript next to orgo this semester. Not-for-credit classes do not factor into your GPA. You can actually go check your unofficial transcript and double check if the NFC shows up next to orgo.  As for your second question about petitioning, I honestly have no clue but hopefully someone else can answer that question for you!
comment,Class,neutral,A bit old but try looking up:  Reddit - uofm - What happens to your GPA/transcript if you retake a class?   https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/n45ds/what_happens_to_your_gpatranscript_if_you_retake/
post,Housing,positive,So I haven't been on campus before and I was planning to be in the dorms next semester to get that "dorm college experience". I know the applications haven't opened yet, but what is it like applying to the dorms as a sophomore? Do we get to choose which dorm we will be in?  Also, which dorm is best for sophomores who are looking to socialize and haven't met anyone yet?
comment,Housing,positive,I lived in dorms for four years. Not sure about current period due to COVID-19 and it seems that it is not based on selection anymore  but assignment. But in the past time, you will select very specific room, i.e room number, residence hall, and even room size. Say Stockwell Hall, # Room 2001, single room, 9x13. All of those information will show up during your selection process.
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôm also a rising sophomore who intends on applying for dorms, but I‚Äôm super anxious that they‚Äôll suddenly screw the sophomores over and not give us space. Ahhh. Also, it‚Äôs hard finding a roommate!
comment,Housing,neutral,A lot of the sophomores live in Stockwell.
post,Housing,positive,So next year I will be living off campus at a house and I need to provide my own internet. Does anybody recommend any providers? Thanks !
comment,Housing,positive,They‚Äôre all roughly equivalent, and available providers vary by address. If you can get gigabit fiber, that‚Äôs awesome. Otherwise just compare promotions at the time and go with whoever‚Äôs got the best price for the package you want
comment,Housing,positive,Call your landlord and ask them what company is already installed into your place, needing to provide your own doesnt necessarily mean that there isnt a pre-established connection ready to be plugged into a router. They may not allow a new company to install as well. Def should ask.
comment,Housing,positive,If you don't have a fiber optic provider (they exist but with limited coverage) Comcast is going to be better than all the other options for most addresses.
comment,Housing,neutral,Most of Ann Arbor has AT&T or Comcast. If AT&T has fiber at your place, choose that, if they don't that means it's DSL, stay away from that. Comcast is your only decent option then.
comment,Housing,neutral,Comcast is usually cheaper but they aren't usually aren't fiber which means your 100 GB is a max that you will never achieve and have to share bandwidth with your neighbors.  Most of the time, that's fine but the few times your internet is slow at 11:56 pm with an assignment due at midnight will be frustrating.  If you have the option for at&t fiber for $5-10 more per month, I would recommend that.
post,Housing,positive,I'm trying to get in the dorms next semester as an upperclassman. They just said the latest you know if your application was accepted is early August. This doesn't make much sense to me. I'm supposed to wait until August to know my housing situation? What if I don't get a spot? Then it's too late to find off campus housing, so what am I supposed to do? Living in the dorms is the best option for me right now financially, but I'm supposed to risk getting no housing at all? Just not sure what to do for housing for the fall, any suggestions? Do I just chance it?
comment,Housing,negative,Realistically, you know how they said dorms will be "about 80%," but that if vaccination rates are higher/cases are lower, it could be more?  Sophomores (and other upperclassmen) are the ones on the edge of this calculation.  They won't finalize all applications until August because they won't commit to housing extra students until they know they can (public health; freshman not coming to campus)‚Äîin August.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are very few actual spots for sophomores‚Äîas disappointing as it is, I know.
comment,Housing,positive,I can‚Äôt stress this enough but HOUSING IS NOT THAT SCARCE! I‚Äôve been through the apartment hunt twice for my sophomore year and junior year (this year). The apartment companies try to make it seem like housing will run out when it NEVER does ever before covid. Don‚Äôt worry too much about signing quickly because there won‚Äôt be any housing left. Wait if you want the dorms (however I‚Äôm confused how it‚Äôs financially better to stay in dorms as financial aid can be used for off campus housing i beeline but not 100% sure and it‚Äôs much cheaper off campus other than the high rises). Either way DONT PANIC! That‚Äôs what they want you to do and sign out of fear. Relax!
comment,Housing,positive,If you want a dorm like experience for sophomore year i‚Äôd recommend checking out Truth and Escher Coops on www.icc.coop , they‚Äôre half the cost but still include food/ close to their respective campuses and have a community aspect + cool spaces to study/ play music/chill in !
comment,Housing,neutral,I‚Äôm in the same situation. I‚Äôll be a sophomore by then, how about you? And don‚Äôt the applications open up next week?
post,New Student,positive,Hi I will be going to Michigan next year for LSA econ and I am also planning on minoring on computer science. I am just wondering if you guys think I should take the AP exams this year if I plan on attempting to transfer to Ross in my sophomore year. I am thinking that maybe I shouldn't because if I retake those similar courses at Michigan I will bee able to get a better GPA my first year. Basically any advice for Michigan would be appreciated.   &#x200B;  Ap tests I would be taking: Ap calc AB, Statistics, AP lit and comp.   &#x200B;  P.s. I understand that admission to Ross is extremely difficult and I know I probably won't get in, but I want to try anyways.
comment,New Student,positive,AP lit/comp don‚Äôt transfer to anything specific.  You will not get a better score in math 115, trust me.   AP stats doesn‚Äôt count for stats 250, just departmental credit.   So there‚Äôs no reason for you to not take them, even if you were trying to sandbag.
post,Food / Culture,positive,What is your go to breakfast spots in A2? I am open to suggestions. Drop down any restaurants that you enjoyed in terms of the quality of service, quality of food, and affordability.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Angelo‚Äôs is always the best, really solid pricing but not dirt-cheap-est, kinda an odd location but great if you‚Äôre on the Hill or in walkable distance.  Fleetwood & Frank‚Äôs: good, fast, cheap. Both classic diners. Fleetwood is really small, farish from campus but walkable, and open 24-7. Frank‚Äôs is larger, far far closer to campus, and comparatively underrated (albeit less aesthetically iconic) compared to Fleetwood, which are pretty equal, all things considered.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Bell‚Äôs diner is a ways off campus but is a wild combo of classic diner and Korean food. It‚Äôs all good
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Afternoon delight was always my spot. Great location and good food. Service is brisk but friendly. They always had a decent salad bar.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I really like aMa‚Äôs bistro. Super close to campus, really good food.  Haven‚Äôt been in a while, usually only went there when family visited, bit too expensive to go frequently as a student.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,My bf and I went to the Broken Egg one day and they only serve brunch things. I got the cinnamon roll pancakes and they were so yummy!
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I'm not too much of a breakfast guy, but on campus, my go-to is Frank's. Good food and service and still reasonably priced. If you can drive then there's also Benny's Diner or Bomber in Ypsi.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I like Northside Grill
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Jagged Fork on Main and William has a really good menu and great mimosas
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Angelo's, Northside, Franks, and Avalon are my favs
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Not sure if they're open this semester, but there's this small cafe in Hutchins Hall (one of the law buildings, on State St.) that has the best breakfast I've ever had in a restaurant. Lot of options to customize it too!  Seating is *technically* reserved for law students, but this is rarely ever enforced.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Fleetwood's Hippie Hash is the best breakfast dish in AA and it's not particularly close
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Dimos deli is highly underrated.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Back before the pandemic, if I wanted to go out to breakfast/brunch my main places were Afternoon Delight and aMa Bistro. These two are a bit pricier, but totally worth it once in a while. These days it's more a quick run to Amer's on State Street for a Meggwich (also, a lot cheaper!). I've only been to Fleetwood Diner twice... but damn it was awesome and affordable. Need to go back. When my parents are in town we'll usually hit up Sava's and Zingerman's, both a lot more expensive but delicious.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Angelo‚Äôs is my favorite casual brunch place, but you have to get there quite early on weekends.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Angelo's is definitely one of the best, as other people have said. Good variety, excellent food.  First Bite has avocado toast and AMAZING pancakes and fingerling potatoes. It's a bit pricy, but the food is very good  Northside Grill and Broken Egg are similar in quality, imo. They're good, but not usually my go to. I've also had some bad experiences with the service at Northside Grill.  Juicy Kitchen is really good, but a bit too far from downtown for me to go often. They have great smoothies though
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I like Zingerman‚Äôs Roadhouse. It‚Äôs a short drive, great if you are ever meeting family because there‚Äôs actual parking lots, and the food is incredible. It really isn‚Äôt very affordable but it‚Äôs top quality and as far as I‚Äôve heard they treat their employees really well, so that factors into it as well. I don‚Äôt know if they have true breakfast? But they have a great brunch menu.
post,Housing,positive,Hey everyone, I know I‚Äôm extremely late in the game, but I desperately need to secure an apartment for the next school year.   something on central would be amazing and I was wondering where I should start looking or which places to avoid. I know there are some high rise buildings to avoid but I truly don‚Äôt know how to even start the process of looking.   If anyone has any recommendations on places that were nice to live in, or any advice they could shed it would be amazing :)
comment,Housing,positive,This question gets posted all the time. There's been 8 posts just this week.  I highly recommend using the search bar or try "uofm housing reddit" on Google, you'll get dozens of results. It's been talked about ad nauseam. We should just have a sticky thread for housing information, honestly.
comment,Housing,positive,You can start at the offcampus housing page through UM: [https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/)  But you can probably find cheaper lease-takeovers or subleases on Facebook. I think the Facebook groups for Class of 2021, 2022, etc have some available.  I'm sure other posts on this subreddit have more advice, but I hope this is somewhat helpful.
comment,Housing,positive,Check out the housing coops! [icc.coop](https://icc.coop) for cool people and a funky time
post,Degree,positive,Has anybody declared for the Econ honors pathway? Would love to chat! TIA
comment,Degree,neutral,You can pm me
comment,Degree,positive,A student with a lot of experiences/coursework in Econs here, including Econ 495, but not as an Honor Econ major since they do not waive my Econ 452 requirements. Feel free to contact.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,The last few semesters has been rough for a lot of us, but I appreciate the fact, some of my classes are recorded. Before Covid, if I had a random note I didn't understand, I just had to take the L. Now I can look back at that lecture to see what my thoughts were.   I know some my profs say recorded lectures will reduce incentives to learn the first time, but I disagree. there's only benefits to having recorded lectures. If you miss class you're not completely screwed, or if you have questions or don't understand something, you can just replay it until you get it on your own time. And it's not like the professor is putting in significantly more extra work.   It's a win for everyone.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,They were recorded for most of my large lecture classes pre covid. My guess is that the uni also put a lot more money into recording software and hardware in campus buildings as a result of covid. So basically I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll still be recorded for you large lecture classes, not sure about small classes
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I'm a professor at another institution now. I wrote an internal grant for recording equipment for this purpose (recorded lecture content to enhance learning). There are several papers that report students benefit from recorded content. The main concern is that people will not show up to lectures, but this can be remedied by having assignments that are due during lectures or small quizzes, etc.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,There are some profs who've always been very touchy about being recorded‚Äîperhaps this will change some of them.  They are the biggest obstacle to this, though.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I don‚Äôt know about other units but in Engineering we already have every classroom set up to record lectures and many were before covid. All the professor has to do is request they be recorded and they will be.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I definitely agree that recorded lectures should stay. It helps students catch what they misheard in lecture or what they misunderstood during class. These recorded lectures should be a supplement to the in-person lectures rather than a replacement of it.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Has there been some sort of university initiative to get rid of lecture recordings I haven't heard of?? Why do you think they won't be around when we go back to in-person classes?  I doubt the university would get rid of them. Many courses had them pre-pandemic and just as many students used the recordings as study tools as they did as an excuse to skip the lectures.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Propose it at the next landsmeet, if you can convince Arl Eamon.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Pre-covid not all classrooms had recording hardware (i.e. a setup that records the screen, audio, and the board automatically), even when a classroom had that setup the professors might have opted against using it to incentivize students to attend lecture . With Covid I hope professors start utilizing that available technology more while providing incentives for students to attend live lectures (5% participation or 1-2% extra credit might be useful).
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,It depends where your class is. The easiest system for us is Lecture Capture, but it is only available in certain rooms and lecture halls (most of USB). I have personally been making at least audio recordings of all my classes since about 2008.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I got admission offer from UMich Ann Arbor for MS Sustainable systems program for Fall 2021. I'm an international student and can only manage my finances for the first quarter at most. Do you guys think I should proceed with my current financial standing with the hope of getting GSI/GSR position after first quarter?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Funding opportunities can vary by department. In mine, for example, they told incoming MS students without funding going into the program that they should not expect to gain funding, but that it is possible. I probably would not count on gaining funding unless your department made some specific guarantee to you. Talk to your contact in the department and explain your situation. Tell them you really want to come study at UM but finances are an issue. They may be able to help.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm in my second year in the same program - PM if you have any questions! There are pretty limited funds for masters students, unfortunately. You can apply to any scholarships that are sent out by OAP but those funds aren't very secure and I wouldn't rely on those. Beyond that, I don't have much advice when it comes to financial aid because I've just been taking out loans, but when it comes to applying for GSI positions, make sure you apply outside of your program as well. I got 2 random GSI appointments not related to SusSys
comment,Prospective Student,negative,That seems awfully risky to me, personally.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I would not suggest relying on a GSI position for funding. They are pretty competitive and will usually only cover a portion of your costs.
post,Student Organization,positive,Basically, are there any student organizations, activities or maybe even courses that an LSA student could take to learn how to play piano?
comment,Student Organization,positive,You should check out [this link](https://smtd.umich.edu/current-students-2/u-m-students-from-other-units/) for information about SMTD courses offered to non-SMTD students. There is a group piano class (PIANO 110) available to non-SMTD students, and at the very bottom there is a link for information about applying for private lessons. Note that the private lessons will have a tuition cost of $250 per semester.  Hope you can find what you‚Äôre looking for!
comment,Student Organization,positive,Piano 150 is a private piano tutoring class where you spend about an hour a week getting tutored by a piano GSI. Fairly standard private lesson style for about 200 ish dollars a semester. I'm not sure if they take new players, they might, but I had to do an audition first.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Yes--you can take a 2-credit piano class through the music school. It's one-on-one lessons with a MA student at UM. It's a great opportunity but there is an additional tuition fee added for it--so make sure you know about that before signing up.
post,Food / Culture,positive,Hello Fellow Wolverines,  I'm wondering is it TRUE that only residents of the dining halls can order to-go meals there?  I'm graduating this semester and I just realized that have hundreds of blue bucks. Where else I can use blue bucks except dining halls / cafe / market?  Thank you!
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I‚Äôm not sure about who can and can‚Äôt use the various dining halls but those blue bucks are as good as cash all over the place on campus. Check out: http://bluebucks.umich.edu/p/locations.html?m=1 for a full list of where you can spend your blue bucks
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Coming from someone who works in the dining halls, anyone who comes in with a meal plan or blue bucks and their responsibleblue check is good to go. Hecc if you forget to get tested and your responsiblue isn't green/yellow, greeters can call over the manager who can then take your order and wrap it up for you. (this is however pretty inconvenient for all parties involved so I recommend always remembering to get tested at least a day before you come in!) On the other hand, you could get a [refund](http://bluebucks.umich.edu/p/home.html) for all of your blue bucks as well.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Dining halls are open to anyone who has a meal plan. For blue bucks, all those stores are open if you have the responsiblue green checkmark
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,dining halls are only for residents as far as i know
post,Degree,positive,For the majors that let you take a certain number of credits in electives for the major, what determines if electives are offered cause looking at the course guide, 400 level classes that are electives are sometimes not offered for 5 terms and then come back up and stay for a few terms. is it based on popularity of the course?
comment,Degree,negative,Usually when that happens they‚Äôre based on a professor and their reflective research/topic area  So thing sometimes go MIA if a professor leaves, takes sabbatical, teaches only 1 course or a handful of other reasons is why they can just disappear for a while/indefinitely
post,COVID-19,negative,At the beginning of the semester I read that we have until 3 weeks into the semester to change to pass/fail. Now I started a 2 credit class 2 weeks ago and I want to do pass / fail. Is the deadline different because it is a half semester class? I also still see the option to change to pass/fail on my student business page.
comment,COVID-19,positive,This ordinarily depends on what college you are in‚Äîbut yes, 7 week courses usually have an earlier deadline.  With that said, all Undergraduates can convert grades to P/NRC (P/F) at the end of this semester due to COVID-19.  [https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/covid-19-fall20-winter21-grading](https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/covid-19-fall20-winter21-grading)
post,Finances,positive,On the financial aid website it says  >The allowance for commuting students is¬†**$5,256**¬†for the academic year to acknowledge ongoing family household expenses (food, utilities, etc.) and transportation costs.  Does anyone know if this is true? Do you have to apply or something? I was never told about this.
comment,Finances,positive,It's not an allowance as in "you get free money if you commute," this just means that when they calculate your expenses for the year they assume you'll be paying about $5,000 for room/board/various other stuff. It's like how if you were planning on living in the dorms, they'll use the average dorm price (around $11,000) to determine how much you'll be paying. All of your expenses combined (tuition + books + room/board etc.) go into your net price, and they decide how much grant money/loans you get by subtracting your expected family contribution from that net price (it's a little more complicated than that, but that's the gist)
post,Housing,positive,I'm graduating in December, I've heard some people have had success with arguing for a short term lease. Thought I'd check here on which ones before I spend half a day calling apartment buildings.   Yes, I know co-ops are a thing, I know dorms are a thing, I know Facebook subleases are a thing.   Thanks in advance!
comment,Housing,neutral,Not typically no If anything you could maybe get a 6 month lease but still very rare for Ann Arbor
comment,Housing,positive,I knew someone who found a true six month lease out by Briarwood.   Otherwise, your best bet is to share a bedroom with a friend who is cool taking over liability for the full rent as a single room after you leave. (I did that with a friend who was graduating in December. I stayed at my boyfriend‚Äôs a lot anyway.)
comment,Housing,positive,I've found good luck from the ones that use the rentcafe.com system. Like Villas at Main Street and Northstar I believe have 3-12 month. But charge differently depending on the term.
comment,Housing,neutral,It‚Äôs possible. More likely if you mention it at the end of a showing and offer to pay a higher rent than advertised
comment,Housing,neutral,[deleted]
post,Housing,positive,Hey wolverines, I‚Äôm an engineering student from Wisconsin looking for a place to stay during my summer internship. How easy would it be to get a dorm or sublet for 12 weeks? Do you guys have a Facebook page where people put up open sublets? Thanks!
comment,Housing,positive,Easy Definitely look on Facebook pages. You‚Äôll be able to find stuff for cheap (under 450$ a month)
comment,Housing,neutral,Check Craigslist, I just found a place there
comment,Housing,positive,Super easy. Students here get locked into 12 month leases and are desperate to recoup some of that money from unused summer rent.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/223351171575348/?ref=share  offcampus housing.umich.edu
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôm trying to sublet my apartment over the summer! It‚Äôs a two bed apt at Willowtree, just a 10-15 min walk to academic buildings on North Campus. Lmk if you‚Äôre interested
comment,Housing,neutral,What months are you looking for? Price range? Location?
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôve got a pretty nice apartment right next to campus that I‚Äôm looking to sublease
post,PSA,neutral,Its 2021 and I've got shit to do.  Let's optimize the classroom by sending emails instead of listening to a professor talk at us for 1+ hours multiple times a week.  /S
comment,PSA,positive,Okay but r/thisbutunironically for lectures where all the prof does is explain the syllabus
comment,PSA,negative,That‚Äôd be one hell of an email
comment,PSA,neutral,This already happens, it's called the lecture notes.
comment,PSA,neutral,I don‚Äôt know how a professor can condense a lecture within emails.
comment,PSA,positive,Me with my public health class. Like if you are not even gonna teach or go over any course material during meetings then can we just not meet at all lol
post,Finances,positive,So I applied to take classes this summer at the Biostation and in doing so applied for the merit based scholarship that the UMBS funds internally. If this scholarship doesn't end up working out, I'm wondering where else students have applied for funding to attend the Biostation over the Summer. Any leads would be much appreciated <3
comment,Finances,positive,I‚Äôm assuming your a LSA student? You should apply for the LSA spring summer scholarship. It asks if you‚Äôre planning on taking classes at the bio station. The deadline I think is March 29th. It‚Äôs super easy to fill out.
comment,Finances,positive,You can also ask if they still offer work-study programs.  I worked as the computer lab tech / "res hall advisor" for a summer back in like 2002, it was pretty fun.  I wasn't taking classes, just earning money, but you might consider it.   On a side note, being an RA at Bug Camp in those tin huts is a lot different from your average dorm.  Sound travels FAR at midnight when those kids are getting drunk and/or having sex.
post,Degree,positive,How concerned should you be about applying to the school of public health your sophomore year? I have heard that the acceptance rate to the cohorts is very low. Is this true?
comment,Degree,positive,Hello! I'm not sure about acceptance rates, but it shouldn't be too difficult if you're a cross campus transfer. Let me know if you have any other questions. I recently got accepted to the program for a BS.
comment,Degree,positive,I do not know about applying for public health, but I am sending positive thoughts to you. GOOD LUCK AND GO BLUE!!!!
post,Degree,positive,Hello fellow Wolverines,  I have looked at the communications major and found out that it is a very versatile major that is applicable in lots of field. I would like to learn more about it. What is the rigor of the courses like? Where are communication and media alumni are working? Pretty much any answer that describes the major. In other words, if you are a communications and media major, please convince someone who has never taken a single communications class why they should be a communications major?  Best, bigwolverinefan2023
comment,Degree,positive,Idk how much money you‚Äôre spending to come to Michigan but it‚Äôs probably more than $0 and there‚Äôs a decent chance it‚Äôs over 6 figures.  If you have an idea of what you want to do after college, or at least what field you want to go into, I would pick a major that will give you the specific skills you need to succeed in that field.  Unless you have ass loads of money you should think of college as an investment in yourself.  Academic exploration in moderate quantities is important for being a well rounded person but if you don‚Äôt focus on your career you‚Äôll end up with a useless degree and possibly thousands of dollars in debt.  You‚Äôre better off exploring with a minor or clubs/ECs.  If you know you want to go into journalism, broadcast or digital media, comms makes sense as a major because you‚Äôll gain skills you need to succeed in those fields.  Outside of that I think you‚Äôd be better suited to a different major, especially if don‚Äôt know what you want to do for a career.  I wouldn‚Äôt consider comms a useless major but it‚Äôs definitely less versatile than CS, stats or PPE/econ.

post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I'm finishing my application in the next 2 days... does anyone have any experience with the program? Anything you wish you knew earlier or things that you weren't aware of that would have affected your decision to apply?  The program seems overwhelmingly positive - I haven't found many disadvantages so I thought I would check with y'all!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Haha well they revoked my acceptance the instant my GPA went from 3.6 to 3.59 so watch out lol

post,Housing,positive,Anyone that lived here care to share their experience? Im stuck between these two and would love some insight.
comment,Housing,negative,UTowers is a renovated (poorly, IMO) older building. When my fianc√© lived there when we were in college (admittedly back in 2013), the water pressure was bad, the AC was window units, and the elevators weren‚Äôt reliable (he got stuck in one for an hour after coming home from the library the night before an exam). Some of that stuff can be improved, but I doubt it has all been totally solved.   The Varsity is new construction, which should mean central air and more reliable infrastructure.
comment,Housing,positive,Varsity is great
comment,Housing,negative,My friend lives in UTowers currently and uh it‚Äôs kinda bad.   He‚Äôs been kicked out bc they have to do work in his room, the temp control on the wall is fake, and the gym is smaller and there‚Äôs no study area at all.
comment,Housing,positive,Lived in UTowers a couple years ago, and it was... okay... but the other comments here are pretty much spot on about the issues with it. Between UTowers and Varsity, go for Varsity - no-brainer.
comment,Housing,positive,UTowers is an overpriced commie block.  It‚Äôs not nearly as cheap as they seem because a lot of people who live there do double occupancy. Idk much about varsity but it‚Äôs definitely better than UTowers.
comment,Housing,positive,Varsity is WAYYY better, it‚Äôs a bit more expensive but UTowers is the worst value housing you can get. There a much better cheaper apartments that aren‚Äôt high rises that are also cheaper but if you want a high rise, Utowers has bad value compared to varsity.
comment,Housing,positive,I plan on living at The Varsity in the fall! I toured the building and it‚Äôs very beautiful and new! It also has great amenities. If you value privacy such has having your own room and bathroom, there are more options at the varsity for that than Utowers. From what I saw on the website, you will only get your own bathroom if you are living by yourself at UTowers
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Hey all!  I got the chance to speak with Anthony Chen who attended UMich Ross as an undergrad. He joined Flexport as Employee #1 (the company now has 2,000 employees and is a market leader) and I asked him about his early days, what he's learnt, and what he's doing now.  Thought I'd share in case anyone finds it useful. Cheers :)  \--------  ## What were you doing before Flexport?  I was working in Venture Capital (at a firm called Signia Venture Partners) in the Bay Area. I was an associate sourcing deals and doing interesting research. Coincidentally, between investing in Flexport and another YC company, Signia went with the other company.  That other company was called Cruise, which got like a $2B exit in two and a half years, so that worked out well for them.  Before the startup world, I was on Wall Street doing Investment Banking.  ## So post college, were you always planning to do Finance? And was doing your own thing or working at a startup always at the back of your mind?  So back then, startups weren‚Äôt as big a thing as they are now. I saw Finance as the fastest way to pay off my student loans. I‚Äôm from an immigrant family, so I paid for most of my education myself. And investment banking let me pay off everything very quickly, within the first 2-3 years.  As a result, though, I was nearly broke when I moved to Silicon Valley! So all that Wall Street money and bonus just went off to paying my student loans.  ## That‚Äôs interesting, because I read somewhere that even Ryan (CEO of Flexport) graduated from his MBA program with like 140k in debt and used his previous business, ImportGenius, to pay that debt off. So, you‚Äôre working at this VC firm - what makes you want to join Flexport?  My background was in Computer Science and Business, so I was always interested in technology. In undergrad, I also spent a lot of time starting and running organisations - starting teams, growing teams, scaling teams etc. And my parents also ran small businesses growing up, so I did a lot of that as a kid.  International trade, freight forwarding, customs brokerage etc - it was all new to me, but because my dad used to receive cargo and stuff for his grocery store, it wasn‚Äôt completely left field.  The reason I joined after doing my due diligence was that a lot of the ‚Äúgoldilocks‚Äù ingredients were there. Ryan was a founder with two successful exits in adjacent industries. I had also done some research on unicorn startups and one of the commonalities was that most of the founders are in their early / mid thirties, have had a prior exit in a similar space, and are working on an enterprise company.  https://preview.redd.it/lzvnallroln61.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95a0ce89b067422353056df248314e0a2c72fb1  So Ryan checked a lot of those buckets. The freight forwarding industry itself was fairly stagnant and ripe for disruption. We were one of the first logistics technology companies to emerge and get funding, so we did something right and helped open the floodgates for plenty of other companies.  Finally, Ryan is a true entrepreneur and someone I wanted to learn from.  ## Did you see joining the company as risky?  When your bank account is small, you have nothing to lose. The only risky thing was not doing anything. I think that the challenge here is that when you leave something that is kind of a prefixed journey (step 1, step 2, etc), a lot of your friends and colleagues are going to really question what you‚Äôre doing.  Your colleagues will see it as a ridiculous risk and wonder why you‚Äôre joining a no name company. But hopefully you‚Äôll also have some good friends who are supportive of what you‚Äôre doing.  I think that when you do a startup or join one at an early stage, you definitely take on risk but you have to trust that no matter what you have to learn or do something. The rest is all upside.  ## What did you join as? Was Ryan even looking to hire someone at the time?  The actual job post that Ryan had was for a jack of all trades. Given my background in engineering, business, and a little bit of design, it seemed to resonate and work well. Mix that in with family entrepreneurial hustle, that also was well received.  And for folks who are looking to join an early stage startup, you have to have no ego and be willing to do anything and everything. My hats consisted of many things. I did ops, sales, finance, design and product.  https://preview.redd.it/sl3prrivoln61.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa2958e4bebd96aa8074feb265c142c557b2dd9  ## Were you getting on the phone with customers at this stage too?  Everyday. So from 9am until 5pm, we‚Äôd have a call every 10 or so minutes. Which means that the entire day we‚Äôd basically just be processing these customer requests, feedbacks, orders etc. And then we‚Äôd actually start the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù from 5pm to 10pm, or until later.  The first year was very aggressive. I lived in Palo Alto at the time so I would be on the CalTrain by 7am, in the office in downtown SF by like 8:30, and then we‚Äôd work until 5 or 6, have dinner, and then work until around 10 again.  Then, I‚Äôd take the CalTrain back to Palo Alto anywhere between 9pm to 11pm, get home, and work from 12 to 2 again. It was crazy because I had to work two shifts since we had both US clients and Asian partners. So when night came, Asia would wake up, and I‚Äôd need to be on the phone with our partners, factories, etc over there.  ## In another interview you mentioned that when you were talking to your customers, you realized their needs were more than just customs clearance. They wanted you guys to manage their whole supply chain. When did that realization occur and is that when you truly realized the scale of the opportunity?  The big picture scale was always apparent. Our trojan horse was customs, and that was the core business for a period of time. We never thought that the business would explode so quickly in terms of scope in the way that it did - that was serendipitous. A lot of it was just down to the fact that success compounds and we had tons of momentum behind us.  To answer your question more directly - since we were on the phone all day with our customers, we got to know their pain points really well. What were they scared of? What sucked for them? These were questions that were really easy for us to answer.  More generally, most people don‚Äôt like to be uncomfortable. People don‚Äôt like pain. But you need it. If you actually want to find out what problem needs solving, you need to feel the pain. If you don‚Äôt feel the pain, you‚Äôre not going to build the right thing and you‚Äôre not going to be able to fix it.  You‚Äôre going to be working from an ivory tower and being all theoretical. So the feedback that we got over the first 3-4 months was overwhelming: our customers felt like their freight partners were often mismanaged their shipments, communicated poorly, coordinated poorly, and lacked accountability. No managed service... We wanted to step up and help.  ## What did these early customers look like? Were you already landing enterprise customers or were these mom&pop shops?  I think the majority of the early stage clients were mom and pop shops. Majority of them were just companies that were googling customs clearance and trying to look for someone to save their ass. And so usually, that didn‚Äôt make for the easiest of customer problems, but it definitely showed us what was painful.  To be honest, when we were more deliberate about the types of customers that we wanted to work with, we wanted to find people that were philosophically aligned with us. I think that‚Äôs true for any partnership you should do as a business. And when we started doing that, we started to find customers who were growing much faster and wanted to work with us. So as you can imagine, a lot of startups and bay area companies resonated with our vision: "to make global trade easy for everyone".  ## In one of your blog posts, you describe the distinction between working on the business vs in the business. Did you enjoy the evolution of your role into one that focused on building systems and ensuring everything ran smoothly? I know a lot of people that prefer just doing the stuff that takes a company from 0-1.  Yeah, many of those rapid changes were a lot of fun and got to really test your mettle. I think the first few years it was a lot about turning the individual into institutional, reflecting about what was working and what wasn‚Äôt.  So, very systematically, every 2 weeks we had workshops that I led to figure out where the holes were in our process. We were very intentional about this - we didn‚Äôt wait for an account exec or an ops teammate to slowly bubble problems up. We were still small, still lean, and our DNA said we want to solve problems.  Everyone on the team felt like they were a true product owner and they were solving problems for the business that went beyond just their job title. Everybody was contributing to how we could improve the process and product.  ## And I think another cool thing here is that I‚Äôve read you guys insist on hiring generalists rather than experts. I‚Äôm sure that helped with building an org that is improving based on first principles and constantly rethinking the way processes are handled?  Yeah, it was very deliberate. We wanted to have a good mix between experienced industry knowledge, experienced tech knowledge, and then the generalist problem solvers. By combining these 3 types of personas together, you created a very strong culture and also a dynamic that allows your team to ask questions like ‚ÄúHey, why isn‚Äôt this tech possible?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHey, why didn‚Äôt the incumbents do something like this before?‚Äù.  And that was very powerful. It made our feedback loop remarkably fast and agile.  ## How do you scale culture? I know one of your big values is radical candor. And I‚Äôm wondering with so many offices now and a much larger number of employees, how do you ensure that these principles you‚Äôve laid out are actually acted upon globally?  That is an ever changing problem with an ever changing solution. So I don‚Äôt have a perfect answer for you. What I can say, it‚Äôs probably one of the biggest topics that every company will always need to keep on top of mind.  Values stem from people. Things like hiring, managing, and coaching. All those elements are important and you need to be intentional about how you do each of those things. For example, are you looking for people that demonstrate these attributes we‚Äôve communicated? Also, are you instilling the right positive feedback loop when they‚Äôre being trained? Do they see that in practice? And then, do you lead or have managers that embody this as well?  In regards to scaling this, it‚Äôs hard. But in my opinion it just needs a real human touch. You are able to scale culture by having strong culture carriers and ultimately that means you need to have strong managers. I think having strong individual culture carriers is great, but if you have a manager that is a strong culture carrier, and they‚Äôre able to recruit, manage, and lead, then that‚Äôs a huge multiplier and you have a 1 to N dynamic.  ## What advice do you have for others looking to join a very early stage venture?  Make it so that your decision is a win-win no matter what happens. And if you feel like your decision is going to be a win-win no matter what happens, then go for it. Because you‚Äôre going to be jittery about joining a new company, you‚Äôre going to weigh the pros and cons, think about what the opportunity costs is, etc - and all of that is true.  But what I mean by "make it win-win", is that you're able to make the best of the situation regardless of whether the company crushes it or has to fold. If the company does well, then great, you're in a win scenario. But what if, for some reason it fails? Do you still feel like you'd be able to pick up new skills? Learn from your leaders and colleagues? Push your comfort zone? And become more tempered? If so, then you've found a win-win scenario.  ## What are you focused on now?  I‚Äôm a light-weight angel investor, but I love working with founders and helping them navigate that seed to late Series A / early B stage. I enjoy helping them figure out how to hire, grow, and build. And ultimately, set up the infrastructure needed to get scaling ready and in place. By no means am I an expert in all these things, but I think for the Seed to Series B stage, my insights are helpful for a lot of entrepreneurs. I love working on those challenges.  \------------  That's it, hope it was helpful!  *If you want to read more interviews like this + accelerate your tech career, you might like* [*my newsletter*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe)*.

comment,Miscellaneous,positive,This is great! Thanks for sharing.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi. I was accepted into LSA at Umich and planning on doing computer science. I understand that in CS ENG u have different prerequisites than LSA, and take identical core classes. But besides that, is there any difference in the two? Will big companies rather see the bachelor in science and engineering than just bachelor of science (LSA) and more likely to choose the engineer cs person. Are the salaries different?
comment,Prospective Student,negative,No. You can ask the engineering career office, they will tell you the difference between salary is insignificant.   For all the big companies, such as Google, FB, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, everybody who wants an interview will get one (assuming it‚Äôs well formatted)  The thing that ultimately matters is passing their series of  technical interviews. So they aren‚Äôt going to make you go through 5 rounds, then reject you simply because you‚Äôre CS-LSA it would be based on performance in those interviews
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,P sure it doesn't matter, the only difference is that CS for LSA is a bachelor's of science and Engin is Bachelors in science and engineering (BSE or smrh). In terms of classes u take more math classes in engin (calc 3 linear engin classes ect) instead of humanities. Ppl in engin have egos and might give u shit for being in LSA but it doesn't matter, just pick the curriculum you like the most
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,If you ever want an MSE from U of M, you will need a BSE. Can't apply with a BS. But, of course, you can go for the MS.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,The only things that are different are distribution requirements and tuition cost. I believe tuition at LSA is cheaper than ENG until you formally declare CS as your major. Only after you declare CS will the LSA tuition go up to the cost of ENG tuition.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I am certain that it does not matter since both CS programs are the same degree. It is just a different name. My advice is to take which path is a better fit for you. For instance, I am taking the LSA route so that I can be exposed to the liberal arts and not having to take a physics class.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Lol no....they're the same. This question gets asked here like every day.
post,Food / Culture,positive,Hello Fellow Wolverines,  Does anyone have a go-to place for on-campus food(dining halls or etc.)? Open to suggestions.  Best, bigwolverinefan2023
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,The dining halls are not open to guests this semester. You have to be a resident to eat there.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Most people prefer Mojo or SouthQuad dining halls.  &#x200B;  If you like Smash Burgers, once it reopens enough, I rccomend Markley dining for smash burgers and chicken tenders, the latter not always available, but smash burgers you  can customizze and make your own pizzas are!!  &#x200B;  Edit: Off campus, most people reccomend Chatime for boba, or CoCo if you have more money to spare, for pizza Pizza House, but again it's expensive, all the pizza places kinda are tbh but I guess Joes pizza has the best deal. Actually no, Cottage Inn is your best bet.  We have No Thai, Insomia Cookies, Poke,  other places too I can't think of. For sushi, Totoro is best.  Panda Express is good, be prepaared to sometimes wait a while at the Chipotle on State Street, unless oyu order online early.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I mean it depends a ton on what you're craving, what you're willing to spend, how much you're willing to walk, etc  If you have a meal plan, then you'll probably just go to one of the nearest dining halls or you can use the Michigan app to see what they're serving ahead of time and decide based on that. Mojo and South Quad have the greatest variety, but I think East Quad is overall usually the best (besides Mondays). Oxford is also lowkey underrated despite it being the smallest.    If you don't have a meal plan, I could recommend:   **Pizza:** Neopapalis (or Cottage Inn for value)   **Asian:** No Thai or Rich JC (Evergreen and Seoul Street on North are also good)   **Mexican:** BTB Burrito or Chelas (La Torre Taqueria is a must try if you can get to Ypsi tho)   **Burgers:** Frita Batidos   **Mediterranean:** Jerusalem Garden   **Caribbean:** Jamaican Jerk Pit   **Something Upscale:** Pacific Rim or Mani Osteria   **Ice Cream:** Michigan Creamery or Blank Slate (Iorios for gelato)   If you're on North Campus: Panda Express
post,Prospective Student,positive,Heard that Umich is a party college.  How true is it?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Well I transferred from umich to jail and rebab so you tell me
comment,Prospective Student,positive,There's no shortage of parties if that's your focus, but I think if you're ranking the chaos of parties or percentage of partiers, MSU or Western Michigan Univerisity would beat U-M. [This](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/top-party-schools/) national ranking puts MSU as 20th partiest in the nation, and U-M 34th. Neither cracked the Princeton Review's [top 20](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=party-schools), but they were using metrics like alcohol and drug use, and hours of non-class study time each day, where the unfortunate number of academically oriented students at U-M drag down our average partying capacity. Barstool Sports, which knows a thing or two about campus debauchery, also failed to recognize any Michigan schools in their ranking of the [best 25 party schools](https://www.barstoolbets.com/blogs/1381906/barstool-sports-top-25-party-schools-1381906). One factor in our shortcomings as a state are longer, colder winters that hinder heavy partying, although the University of Wisconsin overcomes that hurdle to earn a high spot on all three lists, and taking the #1 spot on Niche's list.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I am a transfer student, but I can tell you what I observed based on my friends‚Äô experience at Umich. Yes there are lots of parties at Umich, but they can be avoided since it is a large campus. If you‚Äôre not into the party scene, don‚Äôt worry since Umich offers a vast amount of opportunities to participate in.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi!   I have been accepted to both UMich and UIUC for EE and I would be minoring in CS. I would like to hear some opinions on which one I should choose/is better and why.  Out of state for both, and the difference in tuition isn‚Äôt enough to factor in my decision. My main factors I would say are the college atmosphere, research opportunities, and ECE department quality.  I do not know which one I am leaning towards but I have heard that UMich has a lot more prestige than UIUC, can anyone speak about that?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,How many UMich vs. UIUC threads can we have on this subreddit? It sounds like you are well researched, OP. Are the opinions of biased strangers really going to influence your opinion? If you need justification (or blame) for your decision, I recommend flipping a coin.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If money isn‚Äôt a factor, student life here is better (biased LOL)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I don't think UMich has more prestige than UIUC to anyone who matters quite frankly. True, to a stranger on the street, UMich is a more impressive name drop than UIUC, but to an employer who hires engineers, UIUC ECE department is consistently ranked top 10 in the country.   I think trying to figure out who has the better department is splitting hairs at this level. Be proud you got into both and try to pick the college that you connect with more. Have you visited either? UIUC is definitely really in the middle of nowhere so that might be something to consider.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You will get extremely biased answers since you‚Äôre on a UM forum. Both are great schools, and minor ranking differences don‚Äôt matter when both schools are top 10. I can share some thoughts since I am at UM and a close family member went to UIUC  UIUC strengths: -good research opportunities -highly ranked program -excellent flexibility with double majors -relatively quiet atmosphere on campus, overall a very relaxed vibe -Really great accounting program if you want to do an accelerated MBA.   UIUC weaknesses: -nothing to do on campus -despite the quality of the school being really high, employers don‚Äôt view the school as highly as an Ivy (they absolutely should IMO).    Umich strengths: -UIUC‚Äôs ECE program is as good as UofM‚Äôs, but UofM markets itself better so it will be slightly easier to find internships here most likely -Ann Arbor is a very nice city -Once again excellent opportunities for research and a high ranking EE program.  UM weaknesses: -Weeder classes here are a pain in the ass and tank your GPA for no reason (every school has this issue but U of M is especially annoying in this regard).  -
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,IDK what UI is but UMich is the king of ECE.
post,Housing,neutral,Can anyone tell me more about MRADS and your experience in that program? I am considering about joining this program.
comment,Housing,positive,Unless they‚Äôre making exceptions because of COVID, only incoming freshmen can join MRADS (and most MLCs).   (Sophomores can usually live in MLCs for a second year if they joined that MLC as a freshman and are selected to stay on as a peer mentor.)
post,Prospective Student,positive,i saw on the website that the 4 year renewable scholarships are merit-based, is it the same for the 2 year?  im a prospective transfer student btw and i filled out the scholarship app out about a week ago (i know i wont hear back until mid-late april).
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm assuming you mean the LSA scholarships. The 4 yr scholarships aren't merit-based. They're actually need-based and this applies to the 2 yr scholarships as well. When incoming freshman apply to the 4 yr scholarship, they are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships. However, that's not the case for transfer students bc umich doesn't offer merit-based scholarships at the moment. Also, umich rarely grants merit-based scholarships. I believe they only give out 40 merit-based scholarships to incoming freshman, so it's extremely competitive.  I hope this clears things up a bit!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,LETS GO GET THIS MOOOONEYüí∞
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I was planning to graduate in 3 years as a CS major and I assumed I would be able to get all the ULCS since I came with a bunch of AP credits. Now with the new policy I would essentially be trying to get junior/senior classes as a sophomore/junior. Would I still be able to get into ULCS and other required classes?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Ask your advisor. This is what they‚Äôre for...
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I'm really not sure why people are downvoting. This concern is legitimate even if you agree with the changes. I was also planning to graduate early. I am done w/ EECS 281 this semester as a second semester freshman and now the only remaining classes I have in EECS are ULCS and 370/376. I have no idea if I'll get either of those with this new policy because I've only taken 32 credits here at UofM, whereas I had 80 if you counted APs. Odds are, I will have to literally waste a semester or two waiting on being able to take courses I need to advance in my degree.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Yeah its totally not a big deal. I only came in with a few AP credits (calc and chem only), and its my 4th semester and I'm planning to graduate in 3 years (no summer classes or other funny business, just fitting it all in 6 semesters). If your only concern is being able to register for upper levels, you don't need to worry. Its my first semester in ULCS, and I'm taking ML and Security. If you have the credits to graduate in 3 years, you have the credits to register early enough to get the classes you want, and also the professors are nice and typically help get people in off the waitlist. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions about making 3 years work
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,This is a legitimate concern, but a win-win-win for the university: look good, do a good thing for a number of people, and make more money on the small number of students who have to stay longer now.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,You probably still can but good luck getting the classes you really want with this ü§° policy
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi! I am an incoming grad student at UMich this fall. I want to know how well connected the city of Ann Arbor's public transportation is in and around the city. I most likely won't be bringing a car with me so I just want to make sure I'll be fine without one! I would only mainly need it for groceries tbh and maybe occasionally to the mall I guess. Also, where do I find "affordable" housing ($600-$800/person for 3 or 4 bedroom apartments/houses) in Ann Arbor that isn't terribly far from campus (bc no car!)   Thank you :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The buses in Ann Arbor are sufficient The bus systems is called ATAA/the ride I suggest you look at their site or download the transit app to get a sense of where there routes go. I‚Äôll put it this way, quite a few routes go to the grocery stores however that does you no good if you don‚Äôt live near a route that stops at one.   Plenty of people don‚Äôt bring cars You‚Äôre gonna have to poke around on the Facebook groups for a room (as the way you phrased this you‚Äôre not looking to sign a lease with other people you know) That being said the closer to campus the more expensive rent is.   Also where on campus your degree program is  You may not wanna live down by the stadium if you‚Äôre in the engineering school for example
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I lived in Huron Towers when I was an undergrad in engineering and I would recommend it. It‚Äôs very walkable to North Campus/Mbus/AATA bus stops and I think they have three-bedrooms in your price range. The more frequent Northwood takes you to the Kroger in Plymouth Road Mall from North Campus and the half-hourly city buses also take you there as well as Aldi/Meijer‚Äôs down south. You‚Äôre also on the Bursley-Baits/Northwood routes so even if you‚Äôre out late on Central going back home is never an issue. It‚Äôs also predominantly grad students (I lived with one) so it is quieter than the places on Central.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,It'll get you to the grocery store and mall, although our mall sucks and has started sucking even more with covid.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The best I‚Äôve seen for housing is ~$400 per person, for 4 person units that are 3 blocks from campus. This is 326 E Madison St, rented by Prime Student Housing. Doesn‚Äôt look like that‚Äôs available for fall though. (The weird thing about Ann Arbor is that housing starts getting rented super early‚Äîstudents know if they‚Äôre going to be around for fall by January, so that‚Äôs about when housing starts to go.) Still, that area west of campus around Madison street tends to be cheaper‚Äî offcampushousing.umich.edu/housing is a good resource here. Not ideal location, though, if you‚Äôre going to north campus‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit far south, and not along any of the major bus routes (along state or packard would be better).
post,Finances,positive,I am going to do CS LSA, so when I declare my tuition is going to increase. I plan on taking ULCS electives next semester, so I have to declare before I register for classes. At this point in the semester will I be charged extra for declaring or has that date already passed and I can declare without that worry?
comment,Finances,negative,there is no avoiding this, you will be retroactively charged tuition increase, even if it is after the semester has ended.
comment,Finances,negative,From my understanding, you're charged engineering tuition the semester after you declare a CS-LSA major. At least that's what happened with me. I even got away with declaring a CS minor and taking one ULCS elective in the same semester that I declared my major. That was Winter '19 and then I was charged engineering tuition when I took classes in the Spring' 19
comment,Finances,positive,I declared mid-semester last winter and this retroactive charge came in, and it kinda spooked me, but I just emailed the LSA CS office asking them if anything could be done to fix it, and they were like oh yeah, that's just a mistake, and then they fixed it. It took like a month for the charge to be taken back (I think mostly because the pandemic had just kicked in full gear), but it was taken back eventually.  If you get retroactively charged, just send a courteous email to either [cslsaadvisor@umich.edu](mailto:cslsaadvisor@umich.edu) or  [ugadmin@eecs.umich.edu](mailto:ugadmin@eecs.umich.edu) (I think they're mostly monitored by the same people, but the second one is more popular I think; I did the first email though). The person I communicated with was very understanding and helpful.  I've seen others on here have the same issue and they've gotten it fixed, so I'm fairly sure that you'll be able to work it out if you're caught in the same situation. Maybe the retroactive charge won't come in though, so I'd just declare and see what happens.
comment,Finances,positive,I was able to drop one of my ap credits to go below 55 credits, but you may have to retake that credit again
post,Degree,positive,Do minicourses pop up on your transcript differently? I'm just trying to get some humanities credit at the end of the semester.
comment,Degree,neutral,No
comment,Degree,positive,Yes, they‚Äôll pop up as 1 or 2 credits.   Otherwise no.
comment,Degree,neutral,I thought the humanities credits needed to graduate were picky about taking minicourses? I might be wrong but when I was picking classes for this semester I noticed that there was some stipulations for what classes could be taken for the humanities req.
post,PSA,positive,[Link to page with info from email](https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/registration)    "Backpack for spring/summer/fall 2021 class  registration begins on Wednesday, March 24. We want to make you aware of  an adjustment to registration appointment assignments that will support  student equity and our institutional values.   Starting with the spring/summer/fall 2021 registration  process, registration appointments will be assigned based on credit  earned as a matriculated student at U-M, or at an accredited institution  of higher education and accepted as transfer credit. This applies to  undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in a degree-seeking program  on the Ann Arbor campus.   College credit earned through tests taken before  matriculation, such as Advanced Placement and International  Baccalaureate exams, and tests such as ACT, SAT, AVL, CLEP, and IMAT,  will not be counted for registration priority purposes. The change  ensures that U-M students who attended high schools with few or no  opportunities to earn test credit will not be at a disadvantage in  appointment assignments.   Credit earned before matriculation will continue to satisfy course prerequisites and count toward degree completion. "
comment,PSA,negative,The university conveniently neglected to mention that those students with many AP credits will still be charged extra for their early upperclassmen standing...
comment,PSA,positive,This definitely makes the process more fair. I knew people who came in with like 40 AP credits, which makes things really difficult for those without those options in high school.
comment,PSA,positive,Kids who are coming in with dual enrolled credits are now at a MASSIVE advantage.
comment,PSA,positive,This is good, we shouldn‚Äôt have students from schools that offered way more AP/IB classes to register before actual umich sophomores or even juniors/seniors
comment,PSA,positive,Understand the reason for it but I think there was a better way to go about it. Only count AP credits that count for actual pre reqs towards your registration appointment (I recognize that this might be difficult to do).  &#x200B;  That way students who legitimately skipped classes can have better registration times (so they can get upper level classes earlier), but students who just took a bunch of AP classes that don't count for their degree at all won't.   &#x200B;  For example, under this new system, an engineering student who skips Calc 1, and 2 and physics 140 and 240 with AP credit would have trouble registering for their upper level classes because they haven't attended UMich as long as other students, even though they're just as far into their degree.  &#x200B;  Whatever doesn't affect me I'm graduating lol
comment,PSA,negative,I‚Äôve been advocating for this for years.  UMich considers applicants in the context of their high schools, so I wasn‚Äôt disadvantaged by how few APs my poor, rural school offered. But then I got to campus and not only had to take the intro ‚Äúweeder‚Äù math and science classes that people from better school districts AP‚Äôd out of for a grade, but I also had worse registration dates for our in-major classes that we were all taking at the same pace.
comment,PSA,positive,Are they also going to do this for purposes of determining who has to pay upperclassmen tuition?  (Spoiler alert: no they aren‚Äôt)
comment,PSA,positive,Does anyone know whether credits awarded after testing at UM count toward registration priority? Specifically, I am in the COE and took a foreign language exam and received 8 credits and placed into a third semester class.
comment,PSA,positive,Doesn't this negatively effect you if you're, for example, a senior with only 60 credits because you did AP/IB? You're suddenly scrambling to get into classes that you need to graduate. I feel like there's a better middle ground here, like maybe considering % of progress towards degree instead for assigning registration slots
comment,PSA,positive,I agree this makes sense for things like calc and chem that entire colleges need to take but this should apply only for those paying underclassmen tuition. Once you're taking upperclassmen classes you're in the meat of your major and it shouldn't matter where the credits came from.
comment,PSA,positive,this is huge
comment,PSA,neutral,If only I had this before now.
comment,PSA,positive,So basically I'm going to be paying upper level tuition and have a lower chance of getting classes I need to take for my major because I'm 1-2 years younger nice. I think this presents a problem for people who need major specific courses and are a year ahead because they have got all the prereqs from AP/IB credit. Wish there was a better balance here because the inequality issue definitely needed to be addressed but this wasn't the best implementation.
comment,PSA,positive,I‚Äôve got mixed feelings about this, I‚Äôm an international student so it‚Äôs a fairly uncommon situation, but I came in with 34 credits from my final A Level exams at the end of high school. Now it‚Äôs not a matter of choice or my school offering that program because every student takes them in the UK, plus I had to report my grades in order to attend the University. So I‚Äôm already at upperclassman standing as a freshman, I have about 15 credits that are departmental and are now completely useless because of these changes, and I can‚Äôt even get the excess credit taken off of my transcript because they don‚Äôt let you do that with A Levels (my advisor said they are treated like transfer courses from another university, except now not when it comes to registration?) Obviously it‚Äôs a move in the right direction to make it a more even playing field but I just feel a bit shafted right now.
comment,PSA,positive,I‚Äôm so glad to hear this. I came in with almost no AP credit, whereas almost all my peers had 20-30 credits. Meant they got first pick of classes, meaning better profs and better choice of sections/times/courses overall. That cycle just kept repeating itself all of undergrad too and I always felt behind everyone else bc of it. Really happy to hear this.
comment,PSA,neutral,Whelp, guess I developed mental health problems in high school for no reasonü•∞ AP won‚Äôt help with distribuiton OR registration now
comment,PSA,positive,If one student has Ap credit for Calc 1 and another actually takes Math 115 ,then why is one worth more than the other? Both students are the same distance away from graduation but now one student gets preferential treatment just because they have spent more money in tuition. Wolverine access already has the functionality to determine what credits needed for your degree have already been completed and that should be used to determine registration. This way, people with unnecessary AP classes don't get an advantage while keeping the system fair.
comment,PSA,positive,Please don't apply this change to current students. This screws with so many plans, from early graduates to high schoolers planning their AP class loads. At least let those who are (paying for!) upperclassmen status keep their credits.
comment,PSA,neutral,Will we be refunded for paying upper level tuition based on AP classes?
comment,PSA,positive,See that sounds nice until you realize that it can really mess with people who need specific classes to graduate because they're locked into registering with their specific grade rather than where they are in terms of completing their coursework.      &nbsp;      Ultimately, I question whether people were actually disadvantaged by this - sure, relative to peers of the same *age* you might have been registering after people who came from schools with lots of ways to earn credit ‚Äî but your age is on the whole pretty unimportant in terms of earning your degree, and it seems to me you'd have been competing with people who are of the same progress towards a degree, which seems correct?      &nbsp;      Guess we'll see how this plays out but my initial reaction is that this seems to do more harm than good, given I think prioritizing based on degree completion makes a lot more logical sense than prioritizing based on time spent in college. Would be more than happy to have somebody explain why I'm wrong though!
comment,PSA,positive,Does this screw people who freshman/sophomores who planned to graduate early? I think it‚Äôs better long term cause people are gonna register based on how many uofm credits they have, but I still feel like it ends up screwing a lot of people, not that the older system didn‚Äôt.
comment,PSA,positive,YES!!! I was ranting to my advisor and the registrar's office about this all the time! I'm an international student from a public school where no one even knew what APs were. I have always struggled with getting into the classes I wanted and literally was hysteric every time the registration period came around. Like I had to have not plan B, but D, E, F.
comment,PSA,positive,To those upset about how hard they worked to get those credits: people who didn't have the option to take those credits worked just as hard as you. This is a difficult school to get into. You aren't better than those who weren't afforded the same opportunities as you, even if you paid for them. It wasn't an option for so many other people.   To those whose plans to graduate early might be messed up by this: those of us who rely on financial aid to graduate only get 10 semesters. Please let us graduate within that time frame. No one should have to worry about whether one of their last few semesters of aid will have to be used on filler courses while other people are coming in with enough credit to take those same upperlevel classes.  I'm a double major. I have a minor. Very little overlap between them. I'm now in a position where I have to take 18 credits my last three semesters because of all the filler I had to take. And I started off taking 17, 18 credits and spring and summer courses to get all my requirements out of the way early.
comment,PSA,negative,I'm on track to graduate a year early because a lot of my ap credits count toward my major (cs).  If I'm paying upperclassmen tuition (out of state, no less), and my AP credits are what makes me an upperclassmen, then why am I losing my standing? This "fix" is skirting around the real issue of Umich not having enough classes/professors to accommodate their continual push for a larger student body. They're bringing in more students, making more money, and excusing their inability to give their students what they advertise with some bullshit appeal to equality. I'm disgruntled
comment,PSA,positive,L for the people who spent all the time and money prepping for and taking AP exams.  Basically the only benefit I got out of mine was earlier registration.  If they make this change, AP credits shouldn't count towards getting upper-class standing tuition earlier.
comment,PSA,positive,With them doing this they should also exclude credits coming from any dual enrollment or summer classes from before college, as again these were not opportunities available to everyone. And others had to choose between doing AP's or IB's and taking a dual enrollment path.
comment,PSA,positive,Unpopular opinion: A. I‚Äôm an international student that didn‚Äôt go to an international school that provided AP classes. B. I have 19 AP credits that all count towards my CSE graduation requirements. How? I self studied all those subjects in my own free time on top of my school work in hs while maintaining my GPA.  Why should I be penalized for the extra time and effort that I put in? Not to mention the fees for taking the AP exam.  This policy is basically asking people to all have the same IQ, income, and all other resources, which is impossible and unpractical.
comment,PSA,positive,So basically I'm now last to the trough for any and all upper level classes. Thanks UM!
comment,PSA,positive,Wish me luck registering for required ULCS with 79 credits. Happy I‚Äôll never be able to take high contention classes so long as that means someone who took Calc 1 at umich 3 years ago can!
comment,PSA,neutral,This policy swayed me from commiting to UMich
comment,PSA,positive,Imagine going to a high school with top-notch coursework to allow you to learn and prepare you for your university experience and then being regretful about taking advantage of it once you don't get preferential treatment anymore.
comment,PSA,positive,As someone who was on the waitlist like every semester back in undergrad in CS, I totally support this. My HS focused on a small set of APs and because of that I was at a credit disadvantage every semester. Definitely levels the playing field!
comment,PSA,negative,I'm kinda confused as to why they all of a sudden thought this was unfair. It shouldn't have been implemented in the first place
comment,PSA,neutral,[deleted]
comment,PSA,positive,Just wondering, do college credits before coming to umich count? Like community college classes
comment,PSA,neutral,[deleted]
comment,PSA,positive,Does this apply to credit that was received by taking a placement test offered by U of M? For example I got credit for taking a French placement test during orientation.
comment,PSA,positive,This might be more fair, but it still suffers from the fact that students with AP/IB credits are often competing for upper level classes, and in some cases they are bottlenecked by those classes, meaning if they don't get them they will just have to spend more time paying upper level tuition for classes that don't help them work towards their major.     imo everyone should put in there top choice, second choice, etc. and it should just distribute the classes based on who is bottlenecked by that specific class vs. who has multiple options that will still help them towards their degree.
comment,PSA,positive,lmao it was the only reason i actually got into chem 216 and eng 125 this semester
post,Housing,negative,Looking for something close to campus that‚Äôs also within walking distance of activities, restaurants, grocery stores etc.   Was looking at tower plaza because it seemed to match up with what I want but saw some bad reviews and weird things about Brian the (I think) building manager.  Anyone have any suggestions about apartments or reviews on Tower Plaza?
comment,Housing,positive,I have a friend who lived in Tower Plaza and I've been all around the building and visited other units.   **Pros**: Its biggest selling point is, of course, that it's literally right next to central campus. The units themselves are alright, the sound insolation is fantastic and you don't really hear your neighbors. The appliances are relatively new and they're kept in decent condition (varies by unit owner).  **Cons**: The closet space and bathrooms are very tiny. I am 6'1 and using the bathroom to shower in my friend's studio was not fun. It's cramped and very outdated. Not a lot is included with your rent and fees are high, I don't remember the specifics, but they are definitely higher than normal.
comment,Housing,positive,I used to live in Tower Plaza and liked it, though it was expensive. It's surrounded by dozens of restaurants, it's close to a Walgreens that has basic groceries and toiletries, the sound isolation is the best I've seen, and of course it's right next to campus.  There's also 24/7 security and I've personally seen them turn away creepers who were trying to follow women up to their apartments when the women obliviously didn't want to. They also keep packages for you at the front desk, so you don't have to worry about people stealing them.  Like the other person said though, it's quite cramped - my apartment was about 380 sq. ft and while I didn't mind it, I can see why others might. And of course, the prices are high.
comment,Housing,positive,In the same vein, how do people usually find off campus housing? A couple friends and I are trying to find housing near campus and don‚Äôt really know where to start (which websites, etc).
comment,Housing,positive,Huron towers is good and affordable unless you don‚Äôt want to live on north campus
comment,Housing,positive,I live in Tower Plaza! It‚Äôs a really nice location and it‚Äôs quiet. Rent (and quality of unit) varies by owner and if you can find a private owner, you won‚Äôt have to deal with Brian. Maintenance and security are both great. Most units are pretty expensive though, mostly because of the proximity to campus.
post,Employment,positive,I'm working with a brand new band (all college sophomores) out of Detroit and are in search of a filmmaker to film (not edit) our debut music video. Looking for someone with some basic equipment, ambition and good vibes. We will be shooting in the West Bloomfield area later this month. Willing to pay. DM me if you are interested. This will be an exciting project and it'll be fun.
comment,Employment,neutral,DM‚Äôd!
post,Health / Wellness,positive,This is embarrassing to ask, believe me, but most places want at least 1000, and I just , don't have that. Medicaid doesn't cover it. I'm not sure what NeuroPsych will look like costwise, they can't tell me till I get off their waiting list in October.  I'll have money in August (let's say, 300 - 350 to spend on this? Depends how much my hearing aid costs me with insurance , could be more I can offer (This is America indeed)), so I can wait till then, I just, felt kinda helpless when I realized my insurance really won't help me cover any of this so I wanted to ask around now. Any input or pointers are appreciated.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,1) First of all, undergrad psych students are DEFINITELY NOT qualified to give ADHD evaluations AT ALL and definitely not an evaluation that would be recognized by a doctor, the University, or literally any organization.  2) Second of all, I'm genuinely surprised that Medicaid doesn't cover a neuropsychological or psychiatric/psychological evaluation. I would suggest purchasing the student health insurance if you can afford it. They have a solid insurance plan, but I know cost can be an issue.   3) If you have an unmet need in your financial aid package, I suggest applying for emergency funding. CEW+ will help pay for the cost of student health insurance or medical bills, and the Dean of Students will help you with medical bills. The Dean of Students covered all my medical bills which totaled about $600.  4) I just want to point out the difference between neuropsychological testing/evaluation and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation. Neuropsychological tests are usually very extensive and are often spread out over several days/hours. And neuropsychologists usually have EXTREMELY long waitlists like you mentioned. A psychiatric/psychological evaluation is usually done by a psychiatrist or psychologist and usually only takes an hour or so. Psychiatrist/Psychologists usually don't have a ridiculously long wait list like neuropsychologists (usually a few weeks or maybe a month) and their initial evaluations will be much cheaper like $300-400 vs the >$1000 for a neuropsychological eval. (Also, psychologists don't prescribe meds but psychiatrists do.)  5) I would suggest double checking with Medicaid to see if they would cover a psychiatric/psychological evaluation if you're open to that option  6) Once a doctor gives you an official diagnosis, make sure to register with the SSD office to get approved for accommodations like extra time on exams or extentions on deadlines.   Best of luck! I hope you're able to get the help you need!
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Have you talked to these folks?  https://uhs.umich.edu/mgdcare  And have you reviewed these resources?  https://uhs.umich.edu/financialresources
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I got tested for ADD/ADHD at the beginning of the semester, and I went to the UM Mary A. Rackham Institute (MARI) and there's was around 1000 (with insurance I believe). However, I went to my primary care physician and discusses with them my attention issues and she recommended me someone to test me. Her test was only about 250 (I think insurance covered it but idk cause we hadn't paid our deductible yet). It was super easy, and she did the exam over the phone and sent me the results and it was not very long at all. The whole process was very eye opening and made me feel like I wasn't crazy or unmotivated, and I highly recommend getting tested.  TL;DR talk to your primary doctor and see if they have recommendations. If not, DM me and I can send you info on the person I got tested by,
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Are you still a student? I think there‚Äôs an in-house psychiatrist at UHS and I‚Äôm guessing you could get it done there for no cost, but I could be totally wrong, not sure if you‚Äôve looked into that already

post,Event,positive,Tomorrow is St. Patty‚Äôs and Ik of multiple parties and Jug is opening at 7am. But at most other colleges, St. Patty‚Äôs is not a big deal. Why is it so different at UofM
comment,Event,neutral,‚ÄúAt most other colleges, St Patty‚Äôs is not a big deal.‚Äù  Have you been to other colleges, if anything it‚Äôs a bigger deal at some other ones
comment,Event,positive,At other colleges St Pattys isn‚Äôt a big deal??? Is that a joke? Lol
comment,Event,neutral,All colleges do. It's a fun excuse to get drunk and dance and not be stressed.
comment,Event,positive,St. Patrick's day was so big at Illinois the school scheduled spring break over it so kids wouldn't party.  Now they celebrate Unofficial St. Patrick's day the first or second friday of march instead
comment,Event,negative,All I can think of when I hear of St. Patrick‚Äôs is that shooting scare we had when some sorority girls were popping balloons and someone mistook that for gunshots
comment,Event,positive,It‚Äôs a big deal in Chicago, even for non-students.   It probably has a lot to do with giving folks an excuse to get together and celebrate (read: drink) in the spring when the weather is starting to become tolerable again.  If you‚Äôre doing it this year, please please please take it outside. And don‚Äôt share beer bongs, take peppermint patties from shared handles, etc.
comment,Event,negative,Because winters here are brutal and we only get 2 big darty days
comment,Event,neutral,How many other colleges have you been to around St. Patrick's Day?
comment,Event,neutral,It truly beats me because every St Patty's day I've had here has really sucked.  Freshman year- "shooting" scare- though it might sound funny to look back on it was handled as a very real situation. DPSS was on the radio pursuing a suspect and my now ex was boarded up in a room where they believed the "shooter" was residing.  Soph+junior year- pandemic lol  So I get that it's a big holiday, but like... so many bad memories of it occurring here
comment,Event,positive,Lol. It‚Äôs not as big of a deal outside of college, but I remember a line outside of connors at 6am my senior year.   That‚Äôs a long day of drinking. It‚Äôs an even longer day to bartend.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I have recently been admitted to the aero MSE program. I would really appreciate it if anyone could share any experience they might have in applying for GSI and GSRA positions as master‚Äôs students.  Thanks
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Congrats! I would email your program coordinator and ask about GSI applications for Fall 2021
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I have no idea what it‚Äôs like for engineering things or for GSRA, but I got my GSI position as a first year masters student by looking at the undergrad departments where I had significant prior coursework (major and minor) and seeing if they had GSI applications listed anywhere
post,Degree,positive,I‚Äôll be a Stamps student in the fall but I‚Äôm sure I want to dual degree as I would be able to combine the arts and tech. So it made sense for me to look into UI/UX at the School of Information and CS at LSA. I‚Äôm leaning towards UI/UX because I‚Äôm more interested in the design aspect than the technical side. From what I‚Äôve read, I can‚Äôt help but get the impression that the UI/UX program is regarded as ‚Äúinferior‚Äù to CS and that it isn‚Äôt strong/challenging? Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong because I genuinely want to give it a shot but I‚Äôm kinda hesitant because of my impression of its reputation. I‚Äôm willing to put in the work so I‚Äôm wondering how far a degree in UI/UX can carry me in terms of career prospects, earnings, job stability and the like post-graduation.   If anyone has had experience with the two or one of them, what types of students are these programs a good fit for? Also, is it tough to declare a dual degree once admitted as a first-year to only one school? (I didn‚Äôt apply for preferred admissions for UI/UX nor as a dual applicant for CS) Would I have to apply for cross campus transfer if I want to tack on a UI/UX major but I still plan on remaining a Stamps student? Sorry, just a bit of confusion on how declaring dual degree would work.
comment,Degree,positive,Hey BSI junior concentrating in UX (formerly CS-LSA) and dual degree student here! I agree that UX is focused on design and human centered aspects of tech and CS is focused on more of the theoretical and development side of tech. I would disagree about the negative reputation. Realistically, the program isn‚Äôt going to set you up nicely for a software engineering job, but UMSI is known for their UX program, especially in the UX field. So it‚Äôs definitely worth looking into.  As for the dual degree stuff, don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs confusing for everyone. You do have to apply for a cross campus transfer during your sophomore year, since you can‚Äôt apply for a dual degree with SI until you‚Äôve been accepted into the program. I would probably meet with your Stamps academic advisor in the fall and tell them that you‚Äôre interested in applying for a dual degree so they can help you plan that out.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions or wanna chat about the UX program, UMSI, admissions process, or anything else!
comment,Degree,positive,si gets clowned for being "cs-lite" to quote someone from this sub (heedlessly maybe?) but it really is its own thing. if you choose ux design, you aren't competing with cs kids for jobs. ux is growing and you will make good money if you put in the work and have a good portfolio. the school will teach you html, css, basic javascript, python, and php and sql in terms of technical things. in addition, you will learn design principles for ux research/design.  i have the same reservations about its reputation like you, and am deciding to stay in cs because although i would like a career in front end development, i think eecs is still better than si for that. and yes, you will have to apply for the school of information as a sophomore if you want to go to si, but you can still do the stamps degree while in si.
post,Social,positive,Hello   Thank you mods for allowing us to post. We think many may enjoy and find this useful!  We're a group of local graduate students and alumni who wanted to make a useful tool for others in our shoes. We made a website - [www.wrotz.com](https://www.wrotz.com/) \- where student groups, classmates and students in the same major can connect easily! If anyone here has time to check out our website, any feedback (we absolutely mean ANY!) is welcome and appreciated.  The website becomes more fun, the more students sign up on it. We are working to offer everyone the option of PRIVATE or INVITE-ONLY groups and we are open to any suggestion, criticism, feedback. We know 2020 was especially hard on students, so we wanted to give something back.  Thanks in advance to all who give it a try
comment,Social,neutral,Here is a small user guide and FAQ for people : [www.wrotz.com/faq](https://www.wrotz.com/faq)
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello! I'm currently debating between CS at UMich and UIUC in the engineering schools and was hoping for some insight from current students. While similar questions have been answered before, I do have a few specific concerns surrounding course availability and double majoring that I hoped could be addressed. So far, I've noticed a couple of differentiating factors:  * I want to either double major/minor in business or do a pre-med track and I know that both schools have different policies for how you can apply to study either one. UMich seems more flexible compared to UIUC, but the admissions committee said that UIUC lets you double major easily as well. UMich is also more well-known for most subjects outside of engineering. Ultimately, I want to pursue something in healthcare tech, so I want to go to a college that fits that goal best. * I've heard that at UMich, it's difficult to get the classes you want in CS because the major isn't capped so many people try to sign up. Since the major is capped at UIUC, it's easier to get the CS courses you want there. I do have AP credits though (5 in APCS, 4 in Calc BC, 5s in Economics, 5s in Bio and Chem, 4's in US and World History) so I'm hoping that makes the process easier. * Luckily for me, the cost isn't an issue, but I would prefer the cheaper option (UIUC) if the academic opportunities at both schools are the same/similar enough.  Do you have any input on these considerations and which college I should choose?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,We at this subreddit are definitely biased towards Michigan, since we happened to all choose Michigan when faced with similar decisions in our senior years of high school :)   I'd say Michigan and Illinois are both pretty solid choices academically when it comes to CS, business, and anything pre-med or health care -related. Though Michigan is, sadly, one of the most expensive public universities in the country. However, do keep in mind that you have to complete a separate (and quite competitive) application if you want to do a business double major/minor in the Ross school.  Still, I believe there are still other things other than academic prestige to keep in mind when choosing a college to ~~waste~~ spend your next four years of your life at. Visiting the schools may be out of the window due to the pandemic, but do browse through the schools' subreddits, try to email a few clubs on either side that may interest you, watch our March Madness basketball games on TV, and just try imagining yourself as either a Wolverine or an Illini. Choose whichever school that has a more relatable atmosphere, one that you can learn to love as much as you love your family or your best friends, one in which you are less likely to feel left out as if you were an imposter. Also keep in mind that Ann Arbor is physically a lot closer to a large city (Detroit) than Urbana-Champaign, and you just won't find that kind of natural scenery down in Illinois. Our winters, unfortunately, are equally as crappy.  (Though I have to say that Illinois basketball fans seem to be a lot less chill than those on our side -- even going as far as claiming the regular season Big Ten champion title that we won by having the highest winning percentages in the conference. These have been the terms on which even they agreed on merely two weeks ago!)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Choose whichever school is better for you financially. If they are both the same in that regard, my bias will obviously tell you to come here, to UofM. Ann Arbor is an amazing town and this university is a great place to grow.  I'm coming to the end of my time here, and I've been looking back on my time at the university and in this town and realizing that I've had the best time of my life these past 4 years. I'll always encourage people to capitalize on the opportunities provided by this experience.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UIUC is ranked better in CS and easier to get your classes. Go there.   Some have have done Ross + CS in 4 years, it's tough,sacrifices in-depth learning, also lack of social life. Almost always they get hired for a job role that only requires one of them. You could also major in CS, then get an MBA later down the road. An MBA is always more valuable than an BBA anyways
comment,Prospective Student,positive,thought i‚Äôd toss in my 2 cents too. not gonna lie, cs at michigan is TOUGH. getting into classes can be hard and the major has a competitive aura around it. that being said, the struggle has absolutely been worth it. i (knock on wood) have been able to get off of the waitlist for every cs class i tried to get into and the faculty are amazing. also, can‚Äôt beat having the M on your degree at the end of thats.   i obviously can‚Äôt speak much about other schools, but i do know that double majoring with cs is really tough. i personally am doing a double major with cs and ds and despite the course over lap it‚Äôs gonna be a marathon just to graduate on time. another friend of mine is double majoring with ioe and cs and he feels the same way. also have another buddy who‚Äôs (was) the double major with ross and had to knock it down to a cs minor to graduate on time. if money isn‚Äôt an issue all of that can be fixed with a 5th year, but for some that cost is too much and it‚Äôs a personal choice. if you‚Äôre set on doing the double major and willing to put in the work (it‚Äôs a lot) then michigan can be right for you.   at the end of the day, i‚Äôd also think about student life aspects between the two schools. no matter how much homework and studying you‚Äôre gonna be doing, you‚Äôre still a college student. look into the student life at both schools and see if that can sway you one way or the other. also happy to answer any specific questions (i can get answers from friends about ross + cs, or just about the cs program in general!) in a pm. good luck!! you have two great options and you‚Äôll end up doing well wherever you choose, no doubt.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was in a similar situation as you, but I was also considering a few other schools. I ended up going to Michigan because you are going to spend 4 years at a school. You want to fit in as much as possible, and the difference between the school visits was night and day. I don't know how they are doing school visits during COVID, but the energy that Michigan had was unmatched in any school I visited. Something else to keep in mind is that although UIUC is higher ranked in CS, Michigan is better in almost everything else. If you ever want to switch and do anything else, Michigan is the better option. One thing I noticed while visiting UIUC is that the Engineering department there was their crown jewel, and everything else kind of sucked comparatively. Michigan is pretty good at everything.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Quick add-on to other points, if you are coming in with AP credits, you probably shouldn't come to Michigan. Their new course registration policy is actively punishing students who've taken AP classes in HS.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,If you decide to drop CS and you got to Illinois, you're screwed. They're a mediocre school outside of CS/Engineering. However if you come here and decide to drop CS, you'll still be getting a top notch education.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Learn to use search function before you start CS.

post,Degree,positive,Is it a simple process to declare and get approved a dual degree as a Stamps student? I was admitted to Stamps as a first-year but I'm now realizing that perhaps applying as a dual LSA and Stamps applicant would've been a better move.  I'm considering doing a dual degree in CS and Art&Design so I'm wondering if anyone has done this combination. If so, how were you able to manage? I know that dual degrees are ridiculously hard to balance (literally kiss of death if you factor in CS) but I think this combination would help me achieve my goals post-graduation. I'm heavily considering a fifth year to make this choice (as well as a healthy college experience) feasible. I'll be coming in with AP credits and am willing to plan my courses for my college years so everything would go as smoothly as possible. I considered a minor for either one (most reasonably Art&Design as it won't guarentee stability) but I realized that I don't want art to take second priority. For some background, I almost decided on art school but change my mind last minute as well as spent most of my hs career committed to art if that can attest to my seriousness about a dual degree I guess.
comment,Degree,neutral,Realistically, probably not if you want to have a social life  Both majors have a lot of homework and out of classroom requirements, and have almost 0 overlap in courses  Would just choose one, and maybe see if you can take courses in the other, or explore it as a hobby
comment,Degree,neutral,If you have the money for 5 years then you can probably do it
comment,Degree,positive,If you were to pursue this your best bet would be doing the BA in art and design and CS through LSA. The distribution requirements are surprisingly similar, but beyond that there's very little overlap.
comment,Degree,positive,i'm sure there are people that have done this combination (i haven't), but i can offer you some options:  &#x200B;  dual degree art and cs  you will have to do distribution requirements for both schools, it will be tough  &#x200B;  major in art, minor in cs  you will only have to take up to 281 and an upper level cs elective of your choice  &#x200B;  if you want technical skills but can settle for less rigor, then try the school of information:  &#x200B;  dual degree art and information analysis  you will have to do distribution requirements for both schools, but it will be easier than cs  &#x200B;  dual degree art and user experience design  you will have to do distribution requirements for both schools, but i think ux can be a good complement for you
post,COVID-19,neutral,Has there been news released on how Classes this upcoming spring or summer will be graded? Is it more likely they will follow covid grading or normal pre-covid grading policies.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,All the policies that were implemented apply for the full 2020-21 academic year which runs through spring/summer.  https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/covid-19-fall20-winter21-grading#:~:text=For%20each%20term%2C%20undergraduate%20enrollments,Covid%E2%80%9D%20(NRC)%20grade.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Yeah, there was an email.   > Dear students,  > I am writing with an update on the undergraduate grading policies for the Ann Arbor campus for the upcoming Spring and Summer 2021 terms.  Provost Susan Collins announced on Feb. 12 that the undergraduate policies for grading in Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 will be extended through the Spring and Summer 2021 terms.  These include:  > ‚Ä¢ the option to convert passing grades of A+ through C- to a "Pass"  > ‚Ä¢ the policy to receive a No Record COVID (NRC) grade for grades of D+ through E with an option to convert back to the earned letter grade  > ‚Ä¢ the ability to drop individual classes through the last day of class and not have the course appear on your official transcript.  > Students can request grade conversions after the end of the term. For Spring/Summer 2021, the deadline to request conversions is March 1, 2022.  Important: You are strongly encouraged to work with your advisor before deciding to convert any grade to ensure doing so does not cause any unintended consequences given degree requirements, academic honors, or your future plans. Once you convert a grade, you cannot reverse your decision.  > You can visit our Frequently Asked Questions page for additional details on grading for the 2020-21 Academic Year.  > On a related note, Provost Collins also announced that grading policies for previous terms will not be changed.  This means that courses taken in Spring and Summer 2020 will not have the ability to be converted to Pass or NRC grades.  > If you have any questions, please contact Wolverine Services through email (wolverineservices@umich.edu), phone (734-647-3507), or live chat.  > Sincerely,  > Paul Robinson
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey everyone, I was recently admitted to LSA and I‚Äôm going to visit campus. Are there any recommendations on places to check out on campus or in the city that might help me get a feel of what being a student is like? Thank you so much!!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Unfortunately, Covid has essentially zapped a majority of the student life feel, but if I were you  I'd drive to the campus and just walk around. Try to picture yourself taking classes here, and walking around the campus as a student. Definitely visit the town of Ann Arbor too, as it is a focal point of actually coming to school and studying here. Personally, I didn't gain too much from coming to the campus, as the academics and sports culture solidified UM for me, but I'm sure you'll be able to take something away from walking around the campus.  Congrats on your acceptance, and I hope to see you on campus next fall!!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,On days where it's nicer out (like last week was), campus is a bit more alive, but definitely not as much as normal years. Try coming when there's a day with nice weather and doing a lap around the diag. That's usually a good way to see a good amount of campus stuff.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,One thing you might try is walking a route you might take as a student. Like start by East Quad, grab a cup of coffee from someplace on South University Ave, head to the chem building and pretend you had a class, stroll down Liberty and grab a slice of pizza or something, spin the cube by the Michigan Union, find an ATM and the restrooms in the Union, cut through Angell Hall on your way to the to the diag, sit on a bench and chill for a few, go stare at the Undergrad Library, head to Pinball Pete's on South U for a couple video games, then back to the dorm. You might want to make an account with Spin scooters before you visit, as you'll find those everywhere, and they'll help you cover a more ground on campus.  There are different routes and stops you could make, depending on what dorm appeals to you (if you plan on staying in a dorm), what buildings you might be in more, or what stores or restaurants might interest you, but I think having some realistic destinations, both U destinations and local businesses, will give you some feel for the campus and its relationship within the community.  If you're a student athlete, you might want to start from South Quad, and include a trip to Ferry Field, or if you just like working out every day, maybe start from the hill dorms along Observatory St and swing past the Central Campus Rec Building, or if you might be taking art, music, or CS classes, take a campus shuttle bus from the juncture of North University Ave and Geddes Ave to North Campus and walk around before taking a bus back to Central Campus.  With an official campus tour, you'd probably see more and hear more about buildings you're unlikely to use. The law quad is gorgeous, especially in the spring, and the law library is interesting architecturally, but if you're not in law school, they're kind of irrelevant, while a comic book store or head shop might be regular hangouts for you. You could stop in libraries or computer labs to see what they're like, but maybe aside from napping stations at the library, I'm guessing they're pretty similar between colleges.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you have lots of time, doing a picnic in the arb would be really nice
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Walk down the parts of liberty, state st, and main st near campus. If its nice walk thru the arboretum
post,Class,neutral,What happened to the group chat? It seems like it just disappeared.
comment,Class,neutral,i thought that one kid left and was leader and disbanded chat
comment,Class,positive,My theory is that too many people were talking about the content on the weekly quizzes so the professors pulled the plug.  Honestly, unless the professors say something, we probably won‚Äôt know for sure.  EDIT: ^^ Comment above is probably more correct
comment,Class,neutral,I was wondering the same thing since last night.
post,Degree,positive,I just got rejected from the PPE major and I‚Äôm crushed but what I really want is to get into Ford. I honestly felt pretty positive about it - I have a GPA that‚Äôs higher than the average and lots of extra curriculars. I didn‚Äôt get all the PPE recommended pre-reqs done and my essay was meh. I‚Äôm worried if I didn‚Äôt get into PPE I won‚Äôt get into Ford
comment,Degree,negative,I know someone who was denied from PPE but accepted to Ford last year. So, it‚Äôs possible!
comment,Degree,negative,You might want to review your application materials with somebody already in Ford.  Either ask around a student org or connect with someone on LinkedIn.  Worse comes to worse, you could double major in PoliSci and Econ, apply for the Michigan in WashinghtonDC,  Public Service Internship Program(PSIP),  DSIP, other MCompass engagements such as  Semester in Detroit, utilize the LSA opportunity hub, university career center, department advisors.  Other relevant studies with public policy  intersection are Organizational Studies and School of Information.  And then there‚Äôs always grad school.
post,Social,positive,The title is basically it. I recently got vaccinated and moved back to campus. Now that I'm here, I want to meet new people cause my old friends sorta dipped out on me, but everything is basically closed. What are people doing to meet new people these days?
comment,Social,neutral,They‚Äôre not
comment,Social,neutral,I wouldn't count on anything until everyone (in Mich) starts getting vaccines next month.   Even then the govt probably will wait to fully open until a vaccine threshold is passed, at the local/state/national level, for herd immunity to have a real effect.

post,COVID-19,positive,   ## Give UM Staff Well-being Breaks   As University of Michigan-Ann Arbor staff and allies, we are disappointed that the administration chose to exclude us from the February 24th and March 23rd ‚Äúwell-being breaks.‚Äù Staff are not immune to the pandemic-related stress being experienced across the UM community, and the decision to direct staff to keep the University running in the absence of faculty and students sends the message that the University does not value our well-being. We call on the UM administration to extend the second well-being day, March 23rd, to include all staff or in its place provide all staff with two days off to use when is most appropriate for them.   Find the petition and more info here: [https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/give-um-staff-well-being-breaks](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/give-um-staff-well-being-breaks)
comment,COVID-19,positive,I'm confused, does UM staff have to work breaks in normal times? My understanding is that while classes are not in session during breaks the University is open and therefore staff (and faculty) are expected to work like normal (just no classes).  If you were going to take off during a break you would need to request time off. How is this different than the well-being break days?
comment,COVID-19,positive,Maybe they'll give us extra days off like they did in the fall where they gave us extra season days.  They gave us the day before thanksgiving weekend as well as the two days before christmas as additional days off last year.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Thank you UM staffs, you are essential workers on campus, too important to have a break.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Thank you UM staff for making a virtual semester possible in the middle of the pandemic. You guys are the true heroes!
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I‚Äôm a little confused‚Äîdo staff generally get spring break off?   Don‚Äôt they have an allotment according to PTO/vacation days specified in their contracts?   It seems to me like the request, while *potentially* reasonable, isn‚Äôt remotely related to disparities between this year vs. past years. The staff of the university and the students have never had the same break schedule.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Everyday is a well-being day!
comment,COVID-19,positive,I don‚Äôt think anyone will ever really realize what the essential staff in some of the departments have been through in the last year. I use to have the utmost gratitude for my job and was proud to work here. This pandemic has opened my eyes to the fact that we are disposable and of little importance to anyone. Our health, safety and well-being has at no point been at the top of anyone‚Äôs priority lists and it has been heartbreaking to watch. Yes we can use are PTO but it is hardly a mental health day when using it. Some people only receive 5 hours a month. No matter how much we receive we have either had to use it because of covid already or have to keep it because when we or one of our family members get it we have to have that time to be paid. So taking a day off just to take a day off does nothing but cause worry that it may be a day wasted that we needed when we get sick.
comment,COVID-19,negative,Wait, what the freak, what are they telling you to do those days?
comment,COVID-19,negative,UM Students are customers... paying customers...being forced to not have the college experience UM staff are being paid and now you want the university to pay them and give them vacation... I mean it's a different perspective entirely.  I think UM staff could get unpaid days off which would be a lot easier to sell when the university is coming off all-time low revenues
post,Food / Culture,neutral,What are your go-to place for üßã beverages at A2? I‚Äôm open to suggestions.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Oh boy, here's my personal rankings, feel free to argue:    **1. CoCo -** easily best tasting, but unfortunately on North Campus and kinda slow   **2. Ding Tea -** Still really good tasting, bubbles not as much, good selection   **3. Quickly -** Pretty good, but insane selection and giant portions (the large is HUGE), best value if you want a lot, a bit sweet so get less sugar    **4. Sharetea -** I think they have pretty unique options which are kinda hit or miss, but overall still pretty good   **5. Chatime -** Some people like it more, I think it's alright, bubbles are above average, selection's not great   **6. Sweetings -** One of the OGs that I'd frequent as a freshman/sophomore, but honestly not that good with all the new options   **7. Tea Ninja -** So I've actually only been here once and should give them another try, but my friends and I all found it to be pretty disappointing
comment,Food / Culture,positive,On North, CoCo is pretty solid. I admittedly haven‚Äôt tried a lot of boba tea but I always enjoy it
comment,Food / Culture,positive,CoCo is a Taiwanese chain and I've had it in both Taiwan and Ann Arbor. It tastes identical and is pretty good
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,share tea got the good shit
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Ding Tea is my favorite!
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I like Coco, Sharetea, and Chatime, and which one depends on my mood. I mostly go to Sharetea because I'm craving milk tea with small pearls 80% of the time I want bubble tea, but I don't have a ranking. Reasoning separated for organization:  * **Coco**: very solid milk tea, good fruit teas. I think their milk tea is my favorite out of comparing the milk teas I like. Their pearls are little bit hard for my personal preference but they're fine. I don't come here often because it's on north campus though. * **Sharetea:** they have small pearls, which are my favorite, and I like their fruit teas too. The black tea latte (black tea with milk) is WAY better than their milk tea, and I think I prefer the black tea latte over Coco milk tea. (Also, I'm not lactose intolerant.) I heard that they use fruit jams for these, which makes me feel very healthy. The peach kiwi tea has real kiwi parts in it too :) * **Chatime:** imo, best brown sugar milk! Ding Tea's is okay but it's really expensive (I paid $7 for a regular with tip >.>) and Tea Ninja's was disappointing like what I can make at home (okay, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it). I haven't had Coco's. Also, they use real black sugar pearls and you can taste the difference. I also like the normal pearls since they're perfect for what I like. However, after comparing with other stores, I don't really like their milk tea anymore, and the black tea latte kinda sucks. I also don't think their fruit teas are worth it, it's just syrup.  These are actually all Taiwanese franchises (though I've only seen Coco in Taiwan LOL) :)  A few more thoughts about the other places:  * **Ding Tea**: I feel like it's expensive because they charge you extra for no ice and I'm scarred by the price I paid for the brown sugar milk. I did not like their milk tea. The pearls are a pretty color (yes, this is a pro for me) and they taste decent. * **Sweeting**: I went recently and it was actually okay. If you can get it cheap (like using the first order discount on Snackpass) it's fine but I wouldn't go there to pay regular price if other places are open. * Have not been to **Quickly** and only bought **Tea Ninja** once (and was disappointed), so I can't say anything about them.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Condensing my personal boba tier list a bit:  CoCo is amazing and one of my favourites, it‚Äôs nice that North Campus has a good option nearby.   Sweeting is my favourite around Central Campus, they‚Äôve got a wide selection of teas and a ton of good desserts. Sharetea and Chatime are also really good, though they don‚Äôt have a great selection (and Sharetea only serves drinks in large sizes iirc). Ding Tea tends to be very flavourful, but I personally prefer traditional boba to their ‚Äúgolden‚Äù style.   (I don‚Äôt like TeaNinja, but I‚Äôve heard good things about their non-boba topping options)
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Good to hear there are more shops. There was only Bubble Island last time I was in Ann Arbor.  Seems like it's gone now. Or did it change its name?
comment,Food / Culture,positive,my ranking has switched around a lot but this is what I have come to:   Central:    1.Sharetea    2. Quickly    3.Ding    4. Chatime    5. Tea Ninja    6.Sweetings   North:    1. Coco (1 of 1 LOL)   In terms of pricing, quality and convenience I would say Sharetea and Quickly are probably the best because they have the most deals on Snackpass in addition to generally ok pricing and good portions. I feel like Chatime definitely dropped in my ranking after making the amount they give a little bit less (i.e. more diluted tea etc.) and because my friend worked there and was treated really rudely by the manager. Sweetings I prefer for the rolled ice cream IMO. Tea Ninja has a super nice manager / owner but I just didn't vibe with some of the teas offered personally. Coco is great but a little bit too far away on most days.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,coco is def the best.  i would rank quickly lower than sharetea and chatime bc they can‚Äôt get their tea or the sweetness right.  sweetings is eh, and i haven‚Äôt tried teaninja.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,The only one I‚Äôve been to before is Chatime, and I really like it. I‚Äôm not really a fan of the bubbles so I just get a tea without them though :P
post,Class,positive,Hello everybody. I'm in Math 214 and did really poorly on the first exam. I've done great on everything since though and am slowly raising my grade. I am wondering how much my grade can be raised by the curve, or if anybody here has any experience with the curve in the class and would be willing to share.  Thank you!
comment,Class,neutral,Took it last semester. If I remember correctly, there wasn't really too much curve (especially because it came out that there was some Chegg cheating that happened on the final). However I think that doing bad on Midterm 1 isn't really the end of the world as its only 10% of your grade.   IMO definitely make sure to do well on projects because those can definitely take longer to understand than you may think. Also quick tip for the midterms in that class, just do EVERY practice exam they offer because they like to reuse questions and change them slightly, so knowing how to tackle different types of problems instantly can saves a ton of time.
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôve heard they changed the class since I took but I got a 57 on the first exam, an 94 on the second, and somewhere between 60-80 on the final and got an A-.  I would highly recommend studying old exams.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Hello I have some issues. They are really deliberating. Let us say X happened (but also x1, x2, x3...), but X was the very worst. There are a lot of things (like sensory things) that put me where X happened. There are also other side effects. I feel really bad about talking about it because this was all long ago. I have talked about this with 2 people I have been comfortable with and a couple times through anonymity. The past couple years have been rough. I have some nice and not so nice coping mechanisms. (thank god for soundproof headphones and big stuffed animal). Things that take me back are fairly common things so it's hard (especially when I was living with my family that I was either uncomfortable talking with things about or did not want to hurt their feelings). When I get taken back it takes me about an hour or two to recover fully (I can sort of recover instantly but I risk falling back again). This makes exams very hard as they are timed. Either I have the perfect setup (pay the roommate to be quiet, double check everything) or it consumes me. So far, everything has been okay. Also I wish I could sleep at night lol. Please don't downvote me into oblivion for complaining that would make me have a panic attack haha. I am very scared for when circumstances are not perfect and I fail. For those who will say get over it, you will have these sensory stimulations otherwise, I know I know I am trying I am trying this is really hard I don't like this and everything sucks. I was wondering if I could get extra time on exams and could bring a stuffed animal and headphones like I get to on online exams so I can blockout the other people from taking me back, but like I need a real condition like a disability so I don't know if I can. I have tried fixing this by forcing  myself to experience everything but that just makes me associate more stuff and have more things that take me back so I don't do that. So I signed up for an initial consultation with CAPS and I have that a couple weeks from now. What should I not say to not get put in the luney bin. I am very nervous to talk about it because my parents said if I ever went to a person to talk about it that they would put me in a luney bin (my parents saw the side effects so they know I am crazy). I am not suicidal. I am enjoying this big stuffed animal, it brings me great joy. i dont know man I know know  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Tldr:  I am messed up  I wonder if I can get extra time on exams or an alternate testing location because I am messed up  I am complaining sorry :(  How do I avoid being put in the luney bin when talking to the caps person  stuffed animals save lives  &#x200B;  thank you
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I can‚Äôt answer everything right now, and I‚Äôm confident others will chime in. But to address a big concern of yours...   **If you are not a danger to yourself or others, you are not going to be institutionalized against your will.**  I don‚Äôt think mental health issues need extra stigma so I personally wouldn‚Äôt call an inpatient psych setting a ‚Äúlooney bin.‚Äù (Although it doesn‚Äôt sound like inpatient treatment - especially involuntary inpatient treatment - is what your situation demands.)  The Dean of Students Office may also be helpful.   https://deanofstudents.umich.edu/critical-incidents  https://deanofstudents.umich.edu/article/mental-health-assistance  > Dean of Students staff members are able to guide students, parents, spouses, faculty and staff to a number of supportive options. Contacting the Dean of Students office offers an opportunity to connect students with necessary services and support. Community and campus resources are listed below.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Disclaimer: I am not a mental health professional.  It sounds to me like you have some PTSD. I expect that you could get an alternate testing location/ability to wear headphones during exams without too many problems.  When you go to CAPS, I wouldn't be worried about being sent anywhere against your will. As long as you aren't suicidal and are not planning on hurting anyone else either, then your counselor will just be focused on helping you out as much as they can. They might need to refer you to an outside psychiatrist though, because CAPS doesn't really have the resources to help with longer term treatment. There are some really good ones in the Ann Arbor area, and UofM has some social workers who can help you figure out insurance and payment for counseling.   I feel for you, and I hope you can get the resources you need to recover. Stuffed animals are definitely excellent :)
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,It‚Äôs fairly ‚Äúeasy‚Äù (for lack of better terms) to get diagnosed with anxiety related to testing environments or just general anxiety disorder.  I would assume you would qualify for that at the very least based off of your post, but I have no medical experience whatsoever.  An official diagnosis, recommendation from a medical professional, and the proper paperwork is all you need to qualify for an SSD VISA (testing accommodations).  Idk if CAPS is capable of fulfilling this or if you will need to get an evaluation from a primary care provider.  The evaluation can take a few hours and will likely try to identify sources of issues, so be ready for some questions related x1, x2, x3, etc.  Specific terms of the accommodations are determined by the SSD office using the recommendations of the medical professional who performed the exam.  I cannot provide any insight on the use of headphones or a stuffed animal, but typically accommodations consist of things like extended exam times, the use of ‚Äúquiet rooms‚Äù, and stuff like that.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Stuffed animals do save lives. I have a giant stuffed croc with me at home and I don‚Äôt know what to do when I go to Ann Arbor this fall without him :‚Äô)
post,Prospective Student,positive,I was just accepted to the Master‚Äôs program in Aerospace Engineering and I‚Äôm curious in hearing from students in/recently graduated from it. Would anyone be able to chat about their experiences?
post,Degree,neutral,Does anyone know how competitive it actually is to get into the school of information as a sophomore?
comment,Degree,neutral,They don't like to release stats, it depends on how many people apply. I think the acceptance rate is ~20-30% but that's based on vague comments from professors. They're not allowed to take more than 150ish students each year because then they're "stealing" them from LSA departments and more people apply each year.
post,Housing,neutral,Are you looking for cheap housing in Ann Arbor this summer? My roommates and I are subleasing our 3 bed, 1 bath apartment with a balcony for June-August at State & Packard. We are willing to drop rent as low as $300-400 and even pay for your utilities. If you or anyone you know is interested, please send me a message!
comment,Housing,positive,not interested but you might wanna specify a location at least
post,Class,positive,Do you think that you would be interested if the school had EECS classes over the summer? Personally since the classes are still online I have nothing to do and i think that I would be interested. For a department with 4000 people i find it hard to believe that we cant find the demand to fill even a singular class. Interact with this if you would enroll in an EECS class over the summer(not spring or spring/summer) if there was one.
comment,Class,positive,I'm not sure how open the EECS department would be about changing their schedule. Also, they would have to find a professor willing to teach during the summer and it's not going to be easy to convince professors to give up their two months of post-covid summer vacation. But, I'm sure there are students looking to get ahead on their major requirements and potentially some students that didn't manage to pass classes in the fall/winter would want to make them up in the summer. Definitely worth making a poll on here and maybe getting a petition going if enough ppl respond to the poll. I wonder if there's any professors on reddit that would like to chime in on this post üëÄ   Edit: not necessarily post-covid but by July-August most ppl will be vaccinated.
comment,Class,neutral,they offered EECS classes during the summer term last year. I took EECS 485 over the summer
post,Degree,positive,I just got my application notification from the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics team and I'm on the waitlist :/ I'm happy it's not an outright no, but their email was very vague about the process of getting off the waitlist and with COVID grading, I'm not sure what the conditions would be for making sure I eventually get into the major. Has anyone here been waitlisted for PPE and was able to get in? (During COVID too?)   I've been working towards a 4.0 this semester, but it's possibly I might have to take a Pass in one of my math classes (I'm a math major). If all of my other grades are As and the one class (not PPE-related) is a P, I'm worried this might negatively affect my application. What do y'all think?
comment,Degree,positive,I wish I knew. I just got waitlisted too, and I have a 4.0 so I figured I‚Äôd probably get in. I'm enrolled in one of the econ prereqs right now, so that might be why.   If anyone has any further information, please ping me.
comment,Degree,positive,this is all a guess, but the probability of getting off the waitlist depends entirely on how many accepted people decide to declare. If every accepted student declared PPE, then nobody on the waitlist gets in. Based on how many people pursue this major in addition to Ford/OS/other application majors, there is a strong likelihood that a good deal of people get off the waitlist.   However, how your grades play into that is questionable. Here‚Äôs where I start guessing. Either they have already ranked the waitlist by strength, in which case your position is likely not dependent on a grade from this semester (bc they will have already pulled grades from when you applied). This seems like the most likely scenario. Yet, I could see them reconvening to discuss waitlist slots at a later point, which might entail them pulling grades ~ early or mid april (this is less likely though, especially given their email rhetoric).   So, while it probably doesn‚Äôt matter if you take the P, if you can afford waiting until you have already heard then that might not be the worst idea. If you get in, though, then taking the P definitely doesn‚Äôt matter especially if it‚Äôs not a Core requirement
comment,Degree,neutral,As someone in the major who got in off wait-list, just start working on a backup plan in case you don't get in. Personally mine was to do a philosophy major with several of the PPE core classes as my electives. While I eventually got in, I was almost ready to roll with my alternative plan had I not gotten in. It's definitely a disappointment if that happens as you'll lose some flexibility which is one of the main things the PPE major offers, but at least what I found was that I'd still be able to get most of what I wanted from PPE through a slightly altered major & surrounding plan.
comment,Degree,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Degree,positive,Huh, this probably isn't very helpful but I had no clue that was even a major offered at umich LOL. Anyway, you're grades are looking  pretty solid so I doubt you've been waitlisted because of your grades so maybe it has to do with something else in your application (although what do I know right? I hadn't even heard of this major until a few seconds ago üòÇ)

post,Housing,positive,I have an apartment just off north campus, and my roommates recently told me they are living elsewhere next year. So I am hoping to find 1-2 people (other UofM students since I am one) to replace them come this summer. (lease begins August 1st, possibly earlier move in). I've written up a general pdf to post in many places, the contents of that are below in the screenshot.      If interested or you have some questions PM me and we can get in contact. Note: obviously the asking share of the rent is negotiable; I just wrote down what my current roommates are paying. I'll be a senior come this fall.     Mods if this isn't allowed hear apologies, I couldn't find anything specifically forbidding this in the community rules. Let me know and I will remove the post.  https://preview.redd.it/hmn4zifle3n61.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=05e520e01f75f0d036520c32728d905fa01b1dc8
comment,Housing,positive,Not looking for a roommate atm but I really appreciate the effort of you typing this out, which says a lot. I wish you the best in this search!
post,Food / Culture,negative,That store is a disaster. Every single time I go/order from there.   I ordered from there on Friday, order was 45 mins late and incorrect. I ordered from there yesterday, order was over an hour late and incorrectly made. I ordered from their today and someone stole my order and when they remade it they were out of half the stuff.  They really need to get their sh*t together, cuz they‚Äôre starting to look like OSU.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,I was also there on Friday and same thing happened. They told us to leave and cancel our order... still waiting to see if customer service gets back to me to return my money.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Had a doordash order from there Saturday night. My driver got there and texted me saying they were an hour behind on orders. I did not want to make the driver wait and fuck if I was gonna wait an hour for that...  cancelled. Never again as well
comment,Food / Culture,positive,FWIW, they added an option to complain in the app recently. I used it last week and got an instant refund just for the order being late (still got food like a half-hour later lol).
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Couldn't agree with a post any more
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Pancheros > Chipotle; make better life choices
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Bruh... I was gonna post about this last night. This place is a literal shitshow. I went there for dinner bc Baba Dari was closed and I wasted my money. The food was cold, this random girl asked me if I worked there when I wore a jacket and slides, and I had to order thru some app. Bullshit. I'm going to Baba Dari from now on. At least the food will be hot.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,I think I went to that Chipotle twice during my entire time at Michigan, and after.  You got Panch and BTB!  Sorry to hear about your Chipotle troubles though, and I also feel bad for the line staff, who are working through a pandemic, and might be undertrained, underequipped, and/or understaffed, based on what you shared.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Yeah this is honestly one of the main topics of discussion among my friends. They are understaffed and don‚Äôt have a clear system so it all goes to shit.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,I also ordered from there Saturday and one girl said she had waited an hour and 45 minutes and nobody had even talked to her lol. I just left after hearing that 15 minutes into standing there because fuck that.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,It needed to be said
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,They need a location on north campus ASAP. Or open up a different location for delivery orders. That pick up area is instant anxiety.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Had a similar issue‚Äî back when pandemic started they were over an hour behind on orders, and not letting people into the store to do in person. Think they‚Äôre just not equipped for both in person and online orders   FWIW, the one on washtenaw has been seamless, never had an issue with them (accuracy, delays, or otherwise). Not feasible without a car, but the better option if you can
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Whenever I go, I go in and order in-person and have never had an issue or significant wait. I understand this is not possible or convenient for everyone, but if this is an option for you you‚Äôll get a hassle-free burrito and a nice 20 minute walk in.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,The manager is also pretty rude. One student org was distributing pamphlets for fundraising outside chipotle. The manager literally shouted at those students. It was handled so poorly.  (This was pre-Covid)
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Gotta go Mall Chip at briarwood. Way better always
comment,Food / Culture,positive,The one on washtenaw is great tho! You need a car though
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Is it just my past couple of orders or has no one been getting fajita veggies for a while in their orders from there?
comment,Food / Culture,negative,It's sad but the ingredients quality in that Chipotle is really lacking vs other Chipotle's I've been to. The tomatoes always looks soggy and old, the guac has a gross color to it, etc
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,May I suggest one of the 3 Qdoba locations in Ann Arbor instead?
comment,Food / Culture,positive,yes!! i had this issue like 5 times last semester. i assumed they would‚Äôve fixed that by now... damn
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,I tried going there twice in the last month. The first time it was 20 minutes late. I figured it was a fluke. The second time, I waited 45 minutes and never got it because I had to go back to work. Never ever again. I‚Äôll just go to pancheros
comment,Food / Culture,negative,When the store went to online only ordering, I sent them an email explaining the problem. its gone to complete shit. Very upsetting to see one of the top burrito spots in Ann Arbor go down the drain.

post,COVID-19,neutral,If lectures are going to be online will we be required to be in Ann Arbor?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Not if you have all online classes, unless somehow they try to make you take exams in person, which is unlikely
comment,COVID-19,neutral,You might have to come to Ann Arbor if you have like in person labs or required activities outside of the online lectures. If all your classes are completely online, I doubt they can require you to come.
post,Class,positive,Do you have life experiences? *Of course you do!* Please tell me about them; I have 13 hours to complete this project for my capstone class.  HI UofM! I am a graduating senior and I have a capstone midterm project due at 9am EST. *I'm overwhelmed and I would love to interview you!*  The project is called "Crowdsourcing a Launch Plan" and I have been too busy to start it until two hours ago. This interview consists of \*adulting\* questions like:  1. What makes getting up in the morning worth it for you? 2. What have you learned throughout your career? 3. What advice would you give to a chronically stressed out college graduate like me?  *and so much more! Tell me about your failures, your dreams, and your achievements-- It's kind of like therapy, but advice!*  And if that wasn't enough to excite you to help out with this project, you get to help me! yes me! not fail this capstone project. Here are the pertinent details, taking interviews whenever someone feels bad for me and gives me one:  1. Requesting alumni of any age, preferably those with work experience 2. If you cannot help, I will also gladly take husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, parents, siblings, etc. with careers, dreams, and actual responsibilities outside of work, should you volunteer them or they also feel bad for me. Pets are also accepted to be told that they are good boys and girls. 3. Interviews are for one hour, maximum. 4. 1-2 participants required (I have successfully roped in mom and dad, but have no available friends because of P A N D E M I C) 5. Your information will be kept confidential and non-identifying. 6. Interviews may be conducted via phone, FB calls, Zoom, Bluejeans, etc. Cameras are encouraged to be off-- the Zoom fatigue is real. Pets are the exception. 7. You must believe the earth is round. This is nonnegotiable.  Warning: This interview will require you to talk about failing. If that is too traumatizing due to the \*current circumstances\* (ie the world falling apart), let this serve as a warning.  Thank you all in advance! I appreciate your consideration, but even more so, your interview. I'll be up all night to take these :(

post,PSA,negative,Hey! I saw a cat next to the Pierpont Commons building about 8pm 3/14 and wondered if it‚Äôs lost. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a stray, but it seems very unlikely since the cat looks domesticated and well-groomed. Fluffy brown tabby; poor baby seemed scared and wouldn‚Äôt approach me, so I couldn‚Äôt take a picture. Hope someone recognizes their kitty!

post,Research,positive,This past year I dropped UROP because I couldn‚Äôt find a project and honestly it was a horrible experience my peer mentor person would NOT help me or anything so I just ended up dropping after fall semester.   Can I reapply for sophomore year or will I most likely not make it on? Should I find some other research to do?  I just feel like I need to be doing some research or something to put on my resume and I‚Äôm kind of panicking that I shouldn‚Äôt have dropped.
comment,Research,positive,I understand your frustration and know this year has been terrible for a lot of people in finding projects, but you technically violated a commitment to attend the program for the full academic year. I don't think anybody on this subreddit is going to have the right answer for your specific circumstance.  Assuming you didn't get in touch with Dr. Ferrez before or after dropping UROP, I would recommend doing so ASAP. I would also consider reaching out to labs that are doing research you're interested in so that you set yourself up as best as you can for a placement next fall regardless of whether you're back in UROP or not.
comment,Research,neutral,I don‚Äôt know how they handle this in a normal year, but there is a keen awareness across campus that students had a tough year.  I suspect they may try to accommodate re-applicants, but it‚Äôs also possible there will be a lot of demand from people in a similar position.
comment,Research,neutral,I remember when I was in UROP my peer facilitator had taken UROP in freshman year and dropped halfway through the year. Seeing as how she became a peer facilitator I dont think they have restrictions against you reapplying to UROP
post,Miscellaneous,positive,I want to start learning how to really cruise around on a longboard I've had since highschool. Does anyone know of any good flat areas I could learn to ride around without getting blasted by a car?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Not super close to campus but the Pioneer High School parking lot is HUGE and flat. There's also Burns Park (the park and the neighborhood) which is a good place to tool around.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,My friends really like boarding on the sidewalk at state street right behind the art museum. Maybe you can try going around there and see if you like it.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,north campus is great, just ride in the bike lanes/sidewalk around northwood housing or in the parking lots up there if there's open space! I went there a ton in the summers and it was good. Also, the athletic campus parking lot by the baseball stadium and IM track is another great place to learn, I taught my roommates there. And if the baseball stadium gate is open you can ride around on the sidewalks between softball and baseball!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Recommendations from a fellow longboarder  Paved roads: ‚Ä¢South Forest street on from Hill->Wells ‚Ä¢East Hoover from S Main to State  Parking lots: ‚Ä¢Hill St across from Elbel (Band) Field ‚Ä¢Between Ross and School of Education ‚Ä¢Ross Parking Structure

post,Housing,positive,So I plan on living in an apartment next year and i‚Äôm a freshman who hasn‚Äôt been on campus so I don‚Äôt know anyone yet. Is the roommate randomizer for the specific apartment I want to live at better than the roommate finder on the off campus housing site. If anyone had an experience with any of the two please let me know, the apartment doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Thanks!
comment,Housing,positive,Dorm roomate finder served me super well. Had likeminded roomates. Thennn, I had to leave and it went down hill from there. but I'd say try the apartment finder as apartments will be cheaper and it can be a crapshoot to fine roomates

post,COVID-19,positive,Hi y'all,  I know a lot of people right now are saying that having minimal to no social interaction is really killing them, but tbh I do have some people I can hang out with and it's even more exhausting for me to do so. (that being said, it's my family and my boyfriend's friends, not really mine, so they're overall just exhausting in general)    I feel like I'm losing control this semester, going back and forth between insomnia and sleeping 12+ hours a day. I honestly don't really know that I could even fit in time for hanging out with my friends, even if it was an option, because I honestly always feel way too tired to even use time for myself and the things that I enjoy
comment,COVID-19,positive,Well, ur not alone, but u always need to make time to relax with friends. I often feel like I‚Äôm drowning in work and can‚Äôt spare a minute, but as soon as one of my friends drags me out of my room, my stress levels drop dramatically. I promise that an hour long hang out with some friends will not make you suddenly fail ur classes or make things any worse
comment,COVID-19,positive,It's definitely hard at this time in the semester, but you have to make time for yourself whether that's spending time with your friends or just doing something else besides assignments. Small distractions are definitely worth it, just to change up your daily routine a bit.

post,Housing,positive,Hey! I'm current freshman at UM and last semester was just sad really. I lived in a dorm where we would get multiple COVID cases a day and was honestly super scared of catching it because my dad is immunocompromised. I think because of this I kinda stayed in my room all the time. Although I have a friend group, I feel like I didn't get to rlly know them cause I was scared of catching COVID (a few of them ended up catching it) and didn't hang out a lot. Now for housing next semester, I feel like I kinda screwed up because I don't rlly know who to dorm with (my roommate wanted to room with their friend group) and I feel out of place socially. A lot of the off-campus housing websites have around 10 ppl of my gender and age, so idk where to find roommates as a sophomore next semester. Any advice on what to do? I feel like COVID messing with freshman year has really made me feel down, especially as an OOS student.
comment,Housing,positive,If you can afford it, Stockwell has a lot of single rooms. And the building is all sophomores and generally has other people looking to make friends.   Some people do random roommates in the dorms after freshman year too. I assume that will be even more common next year since your class had a weird first year socially.   The co-ops could be an option for you.   There‚Äôs a roommate finder feature on the university‚Äôs off campus housing website too.   Hopefully next year will be a big improvement for your social life.
comment,Housing,positive,I stayed in a learning community in North Quad (GSP) my sophomore year and honestly met a lot of my friends from it. It had a really great community feel as well so that‚Äôs always an option! But like someone else said, the co-ops are a really nice option too because it‚Äôs a close community and are pretty good about COVID safety and everything from what I‚Äôve heard. Good luck w the search and I hope everything gets a lot better!
post,Food / Culture,neutral,Does anyone know where or when we can buy Girl Scout cookies around campus?

Another option is ordering[online](https://app.abcsmartcookies.com/#/social-link-landing/a87cd0d2-48d6-4975-b6a2-a385ab859fd5), which can be reasonable if you have friends and combine orders.

comment,Food / Culture,neutral,There probably won't be any cookie selling around campus, because all the locations need to be "drive through only", not walk-up.  My daughter will be selling cookies across the street from Kroger on South Maple (not very close to campus, sorry) next Sunday.    You can order online, and we'd be happy to drop off ASAP.

post,Miscellaneous,neutral,I'm trying to download windows onto a USB to use for my own computer which doesn't have anything to boot to right now. I've tried to use Boot Camp on the Mac computers in the computer lab here in East Quad, but I needed an administrator's username and pass to complete it. I've also tried the windows computers in the lab too, but it says I don't have permission to use the computer some reason. Does anyone have any idea what I should do?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Unfortunately, you won't be able to create a bootable USB from a Sites-controlled computer. You need install privileges for that. You'll have to borrow a friend's computer or something.

post,Employment,positive,So I am currently a 1st-year student in engineering, I came from a high school where I did not get prepared well for math and physics. This semester however I am taking Phys 140/141, math 116, and ENGR 101. I recently dropped Econ 101 so I could focus more on math and physics and build my knowledge in the areas so when I take future classes I feel more comfortable. My current GPA is 3.39, and I'm guessing it would be around the same at the end of this semester. I'm worried however that because I dropped econ 101, and have a "W" on my unofficial transcript it will look bad for when I apply for internships. I mainly want to apply next year or the start of my junior year for some defense companies, such as BAE Systems, General Dynamics, or Raytheon. How will this affect me? Has any engineering student been asked about a "W" on their unofficial transcript when applying to such/type of companies? ( ik bc of covid it won't appear on my official transcript, but most of these companies have you upload your transcript and usually ask for an official if they're interested). I plan to take summer classes, about 6 credits, so I can retake econ 101 in the summer since it's a required elective for mechanical engineering, also side question(should I take these classes at a cc or at umich, does that have any effect on how '"credible" it is, I'm considering the cc option because its cheaper and it transfers, but bc I dropped econ at umich I'm not sure on what to do.
comment,Employment,positive,One W as a first year student during a global pandemic - in a non-engineering class to boot - is not going to sink your chances of securing an internship at top companies.   Most hiring teams do not read your transcripts. If they do, it‚Äôs to confirm that you are not lying about your GPA or progress towards graduation.   Don‚Äôt lose sleep over this.  ‚Äî  I dropped Calc III with a W and retook it at WCC over a summer. My grandma died early in the term and I fell behind on work (I didn‚Äôt communicate with my instructors to ask for accommodation or help), which led to the drop. I really don‚Äôt remember anyone asking about it at all, ever. I secured good internships and full time job offers.
comment,Employment,neutral,I would imagine there is a way to send your official transcript to the internships, as it is free to send electronic copies to people through Wolverine Access. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been told the unofficial transcript is solely for you and the official one takes precedence.
comment,Employment,neutral,You can order an official transcript to be sent to yourself, and upload that transcript to companies. It will no longer count as official, but it will only contain the information an official one would.   This is not a big deal at all, and it's why W exists as a grade.
comment,Employment,neutral,This is also a covid semester so that W will only be on the unofficial transcript. If are really concerned (which you shouldn't be, none of the companies I got offers for asked for a transcript), then get an official transcript and send that one which hides the W.
comment,Employment,negative,Ws aren‚Äôt a big deal Plenty of people end up with them when they change majors mid semester and drop classes that don‚Äôt matter or if they signed up for a gen education class that ends up being way to much time  I had 3 Ws on my undergrad transcript and had several internships and got into grad school no problem. I wouldn‚Äôt worry.

Some people have told me to not consider Michigan and only seriously consider UW and UNC but others have said that I should go to Michigan.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Seems pretty clear to me it‚Äôs not worth it. You have great options in UNC, UW, and A&M. Loans are a bitch, especially with med school coming after. I‚Äôm sure this is the case at many schools, but almost every pre-med I knew didn‚Äôt end up going to med school at UM (including myself). Premed classes are often extremely challenging even compared to other prestigious schools (Orgo is notoriously hard at UM). Lots of B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs freshman year that ruin people‚Äôs plans. I even knew people that transferred to easier schools to try to salvage their GPA. Undergrad institution is less important than many think when It comes to med school admissions. If the gap between UM and your other options was enormous I might consider but you really will do just fine at one of your other options.  Edit: this was a very negative comment I realized. I love UM and think it‚Äôs a great school. Ann Arbor is probably my favorite city of all time too. And I definitely benefitted from opportunities available at UM that may not be as prevalent elsewhere. One other thing I thought of is this: statistically, you are unlikely to actually go to med school (most pre-meds drop at some point). If you decide you don‚Äôt want to go to med school and pursue another major/career, you will probably benefit most having a degree from UM.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you're diehard premed, I would say go to the school where you think you can succeed the most academically. When you say "well-regarded for premed," that really means "has a lot of resources for premeds," but that does not mean that that UMich's name alone makes your chances of getting into med school automatically higher in the eyes of med school admissions committees.  To reference the schools on your list, a 3.7-4.0 at Texas A&M would be viewed exponentially more favorably by med school admissions than a 3.4 at UMich for example. Med. school is kinda different in that its admissions process is a lot more traditional than people finding jobs (generally speaking) as GPA/MCAT are the most important admissions factors, with everything else (volunteering, research, etc.) following afterwards.  Basically, the school where you feel you could academically perform the best is what you wanna look at if you're premed. You can make up premed resume gaps such as a lack of research or volunteering with a gap year or two after undergrad, but it is way way harder to repair a less-than-optimal GPA. If you feel that "best" school is UMich, then go for it!  Aside from the academics, I can say the culture here is great. There's a lot of awesome people and so many ways to connect to other students on campus, whether it's through sports, clubs, parties, etc., pre-covid of course. Also, you're on the UM sub, so answers will def. be biased toward UM.  Congrats on your offers, and hope everything works out!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Look I will be honest. There is NOTHING special about UofM that is worth the crazy out of state cost. Student loans are never worth it in my opinion. If I was out of state, Michigan would not even be on my radar for where to go. Student loans can screw you over for the rest of your life and a slightly better degree (if even that) is not worth it. You will have the same opportunities regardless of where you go. Good Luck!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I can see from your comments in this thread that you're no longer considering UM (and I agree, I don't think it's worth the loans compared to your other options), so a quick comment on UNC vs UW (I was admitted to and toured UNC and I'm from the PNW so I know a fair amount about UDub too): UNC's admitted students tour felt chock full of pre-meds and it's definitely well-regarded for that, but so is UDub. Based on your comments about location and weather, I definitely think you'd enjoy UDub more, and everyone I know who's gone to UDub seems to have enjoyed the overall atmosphere. I agree in that UNC's campus didn't seem as 'I belong here' to me as Michigan and Seattle both have felt. Then again, please take this with a gigantic grain of salt because I don't personally go to either school lol.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I want to study electrical engineering but I haven't been accepted directly to EECS department, just the College of Engineering. I know EECS is probably the most sought after department by engineering students at Michigan, so I was wondering, do I have to apply to EECS or can anyone declare EECS at will?   I don't care if there's a GPA or course requirement for EECS, I just don't want the uncertainty of an application.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Here are the details of declaring a CoE major: https://advising.engin.umich.edu/declaring-or-changing-major/  For now, the most pertinent thing is that you need to complete 1 semester of classes before you can declare. But you can always contact the undergrad program advisor to informally talk about requirements, etc.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,In CoE, declaring an EECS major is the same as declaring any other CoE major. You have to meet a few course requirements and a 2.0 GPA cutoff in order to declare, but there's no application to "be accepted to the EECS department".  You just start taking classes here, and once you've satisfied the prerequisites to declare any CoE major (requirements are the same for all of them), you can set up an appointment with an advisor, and then you can just declare the major.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm an out of state student living in Illinois and plan to do premed. Academics wise I'm would say I'm average for uofm. My family income is around 110k.   Does anyone know if I'll get enough financial aid to make up for being an OOS student because I already got an acceptance to UIUC with a $5k yearly grant so I want to know if it's waiting for the financial aid information to come out in April. To put it simply, I just want to know if it's worth waiting for the financial aid info, in the hopes of the costs of attending UIUC and UMich be around the same, or if I should just accept the UIUC admission.  Thanks.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,For people opining on the family income OP shared, remember that things like a family‚Äôs assets and the number of kids they will have in college matter also for financial aid purposes.   Without knowing everything else that plugs into the financial aid application (or the estimator calculator that the university provides), it‚Äôs impossible to say how much aid another student with the same family income might receive from UM.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Tbh 110k is pretty high and Umich is unlikely to give you enough financial aid for OOS tuition to be cheaper than UIUC in-state. You're better off going with UIUC because UMich does not guarantee meeting financial need for out-of-state students.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Have you tried estimating your aid using the university‚Äôs financial aid calculator?   https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/umich  https://finaid.umich.edu/tools-resources/planning-tools-calculators  Long story short: Michigan does not give much merit aid. I would not expect that UMich OOS will price out to be the same or cheaper than UIUC In State. It will very likely cost a lot more to attend UMich. Since you want to go to (very expensive) grad school, it seems wise to pick an affordable option for undergrad.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'd say I'm a pretty close comparison to your situation, as I'm from Illinois and come from the same income bracket between 100k-125k. I don't believe academics play a role in financial aid, as we're not talking about scholarships or anything of that sort. Last year, I received about 16k from Umich, so I'd say wait it out and see what happens!

I saw Mike Wallace, the journalist, just strolling around the Diag. His producer said I could talk to him but it felt weird with the camera and everything, so I kept on my way to class.   Patrick Stewart was around with the RSC for a bit. I saw him the Power Center and as the honorary game opener guy (Grand Marshal?).  Speaking of Patrick Stewart, LeVar Burton was probably around cause his daughter went to the U.  I'm a biology nerd, so these are celebrities to me. I was at a conference with Francis Collins. He saw my data presented by my PI. I got my book signed by Richard Dawkins at the Michigan Theater.   I met Seth Rogen's wife at the Michigan Theater as well, who had shown a movie she directed.  The state had a film tax incentive for a little while, so there were a few movies shot in and around campus at the time, including the previously mentioned The Five-Year Engagement. I heard about Jason Segel drinking at the bars at the time.  EDIT: I vaguely remember some very famous woman at the The Brown Jug with friends one night. I used to get pretty drunk back then. I'll try to remember.

post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,In high school, I had an effortless 4.0 GPA taking advanced classes. I didn't have to study and I did about 10 hours of homework at home during my entire time in high school because I could just do everything else at school. I thought this whole school thing was easy, I'm a damn genius. My whole family were Michigan fans, but I was the first to actually attend, and I thought it was going to continue to be easy.  &#x200B;  It was not easy. In fact, classes at Michigan were brutal, every one of them. I learned how to properly study and do homework, but not fast enough. I kept failing classes to the point I was at least a year behind. I kept trying to get better, but it wasn't working, I kept barely passing or outright failing classes. By the time that I should have been graduating, I was actually on academic probation. I took a semester off of school because I was kicked out, not because I wanted to. I came back and I was pushing 25 years old and racking up a ridiculous amount of debt. I finally learned how to study and passed the remaining classes I needed to get my bachelor's, it was practically a miracle.  &#x200B;  I'm basically a case study on how not to do things. Follow my path if you want to be buried in debt and filled with doubt.  &#x200B;  Well, now I have all of my private loans paid off and I am buying my own place. A failure like me has achieved this much, just imagine what a successful person could have do.

comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,you ARE a successful person--it sounds like you had some challenges and found a way to work through them. Almost nobody has a straight path.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I did too.  I worked multiple jobs to put myself through U of M.  Had ZERO family support.  Had very little external financial support and couldn't get student loans (which turned out to be a blessing in disguise).  So with the rigor of classes at Michigan, I often couldn't take a full course load and work to live... so it took me almost 7 years to get my degree.  I never complained once.  I never played a victim card.  I'm not a failure and neither are you.  It's about time people stopped with this self loathing (but I get why you all do it as that's what you've been indoctrinated to) and love themselves, love their accomplishments, and love Michigan!

comment,COVID-19,positive,(I'm prefacing my post by saying this is just my opinion and I'm speaking only from my personal viewpoint as a staff member. I can't speak for all UM staff, faculty, or anyone other than myself)  I'm a staff member on campus, and trust me I know that this year has really sucked for most students. We all want to get back to "normal-ish." **However, I would strongly caution students against taking these plans as gospel.** Keep in mind that Schlissel's role in the university is very big picture, setting the vision, etc. It's not really his role to consider the reality of how this "vision" will be carried out, which is going to be much trickier. Something as simple as having an appointment with a staff or faculty member is going to be difficult to do "with mitigation measures in place." Is there even enough room in the person's office to maintain 6 ft of distance? If the door can't be closed for airflow, how will sensitive student information be able to be discussed? Is the furniture configured in a way that would allow for plexiglass to be installed (most cubicle set ups have built in furniture that can't be moved- also yes, there are some people advising students out of cubicles. I'm one of them)?   The state also didn't prioritize higher education in an earlier group like they did K-12. So the majority of your faculty and staff (unless they are 50+ w/ certain health conditions) will be fighting to get vaccine appointments right alongside you in Phase 2.   It's possible I'm being a pessimist, but I am really hesitant about what fall will look like and how much of this vision will actually play out. I just ask of you students that if your department decides to be more conservative with their reopening process or these plans end up changing, please be patient with the faculty and staff trying to carry everything out! We're still trying to protect the greater UM community (which includes all of you!)  **TL;DR**\- speaking only from my opinion as a staff member (and not for anyone other than myself), I caution students from getting too attached to these tentative plans. The logistics of carrying out Schlissel's vision for fall are going to be tricky since there will likely still need to be some mitigation measures in place. These plans may change and/or individual units may decide to be more conservative with how they approach fall. Please continue to be patient with faculty and staff!

post,COVID-19,negative,I'm gradually doing what I can and need to to fix myself , reach  out to people . . .but Imma be real with yall. I wasn't really taught self esteem. As a result, there were so, so many fucking shitty things that happened to me that totally killed me emotionally. I am hoping to start therapy, hoping it;s possible to receive free therapy. But yeah, I'm just really scared because it feels like the people at my school, I don't fit into their group. I feel so fucking alone and haunted by what happened with my peers, feeling like it's just my fault, I'm just that horrible, I always had a hard time making friends. Please don't tell me it's what I make of it. I'm doing all I can to make friends while dealing with my mental health situation while dealing with my school work.  I'm scared that the people who refuse or are scared to get vaccinated are going to be the reason things stay in this shitty place. Even then, even then I feel so fucking depressed. It's not about Covid. My life just fucked me up that much. All I want is for life to not be so depressing I'm going to die at this rate. I'm surrounded by selfish people in and out of my school that because I don't fit into their spot perfectly, they refuse to accept me. How the fuck do I live in such a world?
comment,COVID-19,positive,How are things going outside of your social activities? Are you feeling healthy? Do you have a routine? I can only speak from my own experience, but I've felt what you're feeling in the past and the missing piece was continuous investment in my wellbeing. Sleep schedule not regular? Start there. Shitty diet? Buy yourself some fruits and veggies. Find challenges worth conquering in your circle of influence (be it school work, keeping up with family, keeping a clean living space, etc.) You'll find that this stuff can take a lot of time out of your day where you're stuck in negative mental spaces thinking about self-deprecating hypotheticals. At the end of the day, you feel accomplished. At the end of the week, you feel well rested after a few nights of regular sleep. At the end of the month, you've got a smile on your face and confidence in yourself because you've just raised the bar for your state of mind. And those time horizons may be different for you, I was trying to illustrate how baby steps can lead to an appreciable difference in mental health as long as you stay consistent. Find your value in the things you do for yourself, especially during these times.
post,COVID-19,positive,Seems like campus MAY be opening up for Fall 2021, some highlights include:  * by the end of the summer, the vast majority of staff/faculty/GSIs will be vaccinated, if they choose so * increased number of open study spaces with extended hours * some on-campus jobs may be allowed to go back in person * small to moderate-sized classes could potentially be in person * large lectures may be remote (didn't say what qualifies as small, moderate, or large) * could possibly accommodate needs by providing a choice of choosing hybrid or in-person? * social distancing and masks still most likely required  I'm sure all of this will be finalized as Fall comes up. Curious to hear thoughts from community members

comment,COVID-19,positive,What about international students? Different countries are having way different rates of vaccination, so I‚Äôd imagine there is still gonna be heavy travel restrictions for students from certain places? How is the University going to accommodate them?
comment,COVID-19,positive,I hope they require people to submit proof of vaccination before taking in-person classes. As it is people already have to submit vaccination records for other infectious diseases before they even attend freshman year, so it's hardly "unheard of."  Seems like it would be the best way to handle returning to in-person.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Why would social distancing and masks be necessary if everyone's had the option to be vaccinated?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,>* by the end of the summer, the vast majority of staff/faculty/GSIs will be vaccinated, if they choose so  Most of the students too, no?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I'm assuming most people saw the statement that "Most classes will be in-person except for big lectures which will be offered remotely". When I looked at the course guide for Fall 2021 and filtered it to show online-only classes, I saw that there were very few of them were actually online. Does anyone know the cutoff for when classes will be put online or what size lectures would most likely be online?
comment,COVID-19,positive,> by the end of the summer, the vast majority of staff/faculty/GSIs will be vaccinated, if they choose so   ... But where is the advocacy for us to get the vaccine in a timely manner? If we're talking about 2 dose vaccines, faculty/staff would need to be getting their first doses sometime in June to be fully vaccinated by August. I know the state is going to have open eligibility starting April 5, but I've already had to spend hours trying to find open appointments for my senior citizen parents. It's going to be hell trying to find an appointment once it's widespread! If the university really cared about our health and safety, there would be some sort of prioritization opportunity for us to get vaccinated (i.e. an on campus vaccine clinic for faculty/staff/GSIs) but Schlissel basically said in the briefing today that he's not planning to advocate for faculty/staff to be prioritized for vaccines.   I'm disappointed because the initial vaccine messaging to staff was that we'd be able to get our vaccine through Michigan Medicine if we wanted it. Now it really feels like we're being thrown to the wolves to try to find one before fall since that was shared almost as an expectation today, even though the university is doing nothing to help us meet that expectation.
post,COVID-19,neutral,I know that some of us are drowning in asynchronous lectures, more readings, homework, and various obligations. As MLK once said, ‚ÄúIf you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.‚Äù This is a message that resonates with all from the past, present, and future. Do not give up, you‚Äôre almost there, and you‚Äôre able to see the light at the end of the tunnel!
comment,COVID-19,negative,I hope they jeep asynchronous lectures as an option, I always hated having to show up when Im barely awake just to get iclicker points
post,Housing,neutral,Did any of you as freshman live in an apartment near campus? Or is it better to live in dorms first year?  If you lived in a dorm first year was it difficult to find housing sophomore year?
comment,Housing,positive,I did this past year because of covid and I‚Äôve heard from everyone in the dorms it was the right choice to make. I just wanted to be on campus the whole year instead of being sent home so that was my main decision.   Idk what you mean by it being ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but I would say I didn‚Äôt meet a ton of people just because I wasn‚Äôt where the majority of freshman were (dorms) but I made stronger friendships through organizations I chose to be a part of instead of random people I met in dorms
comment,Housing,positive,For most freshmen, the dorms are a good option.   For some people with special situations, an off campus option can be better. Some examples I have heard of:  - People who do not want to live in co-ed living environments (Michigan does not have any all male dorms and very few rooms are in all female dorms. Most corridors are single sex anyway. But roommates may have guests of the opposite sex.) - People who need to save money (the co-ops may be a good option here since they still provide a community environment, included utilities and meals, etc.) - People who received their housing contract and were unhappy with the assignment (for some it‚Äôs North Campus, for others it‚Äôs a less renovated building...if you and your family want to pay for you to have a luxury apartment, you‚Äôre welcome to do so)

post,Prospective Student,positive,1. Do y‚Äôall exist?  2. How is the workload?  3. Do you feel like you know enough and care enough about both subjects? 4. Why the two you picked?  5. Would you recommend that?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Not a current student but..  1. Also yes, studied history and biology  2. The science courses were absolutely the bulk of my workload in years 1 and 2, kind of flipped in my junior and senior year.  3. Yes, definitely. Or, I mean I did. It's been 10 years and I sure couldn't fill out my biochem cell energy pathways map anymore.  4. I don't remember thinking too critically about this. History and science were the two subjects I enjoyed most in high school, so I took a bunch of those classes when I got to Michigan. I had no intention of pursuing a career in STEM but liked the variety in my course schedule and was really interested in what I was learning.   5. Exactly what u/jmsouis said.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I am currently a cs and polisci major, although that is likely to change to cs and math with a polisci minor in the near future. There are certainly plenty of people who study econ and a stem subject like math, cs, ds, or stats, and I know a few people who are premed so they are doing a bio related major and then one in a social science of their choosing that they are super interested. So yes, there are certainly people doing both stem and social sciences.   I don't think my workload is any different than it would be if I was taking random electives instead of polisci, so the workload is fine.   Since you fulfill the requirements for both majors you certainly know enough about both subjects, and as to whether you care about them, that is up to each individual. I realized I am more passionate about math than I am polisci, so that is why I am switching, but when I was more into polisci there was certainly plenty of passion for that and cs.  &#x200B;  I picked cs and polisci because I was interested in going into academia, and cs seemed like it would give me a big leg up in admission to PhD programs. It was also a fairly strong back up plan in case academia didn't work out.  I ended up realizing I actually enjoyed cs, so then I got more into it because of the growing use of quantitative skills in social sciences.  &#x200B;  If you are interested in both I would certainly recommend it. For my polisci class last semester I used machine learning, specifically k means clustering, to analyze religious sermons, so there really is a lot of cool work to be done at the intersection of stem and polisci. I have had good experiences so far since I enjoy both, but of course everyone's milage may vary.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. double majoring sociology and cs 2. i came in with credit for EECS 183 but that's it. however, I decided I want to do this since sophomore year, planned out the rest of the college w/ my academic advisor (they're really helpful - use the resources in Newnan!) The workload each semester is typically 14 - 17 credits for me (this semester I'm taking 14). 3. yes! I think both majors are important to me. 4. because I took an intro class in Soc and completely fallen in love with it, talked to the advisor in the Soc department and decided this is something I'd like to do (a good sign to look for when deciding if you'd like to do a major, is if all or most of the upper-level courses seem appealing to you). for cs, I always had a love for programming and building stuff. 5. yes if you are slowly figuring out you can't divide your passion into two! i don't regret my choice and sometimes have a lot of fun switching from social science brain to stem brain, or sometimes connect the two :)  don't hesitate to dm if you have any questions!
post,COVID-19,positive,We don't know what the Fall plan will be, it's an exciting, but scary morning today. Most likely though, we are going to be moving towards what we know as normal. However, we can't act like this never happened. We have to evolve with this event, stitched into our school's history.  Just like we evolve as individuals when significant things happen in our lives.  So let's figure out how we can do that. I will list some things we must keep in mind, and things we should do moving forward, and you can name your own too.  &#x200B;  We must remember that when push came to shove, time after time, our school chose profit, over our safety. We must continue to counter any self congratualatory schpeel they put out, with acknowledgement of the good, but also the unarguable bad.  We must remember that the events this world event caused, have altered the mental well being for many wolverines to a greater degree. Some lost loved ones, jobs, developed depression out of isolation, etc. We must continue the culture  heightened mental health awareness for them, and the people who still experience bad mental health conditions they had before, and might carry after, this pandemic.  &#x200B;  Right now, we shouldn't force vaccines, but we should be engaging our with our community and talking to those with reservations of the vaccine. Seeing if we can talk them through their fears, support them, so we can have as much herd immunity as possible. We won't convince everyone, but civil, safe engagement will be key. Also yes, some can't due to their immune systems, I'm aware.  &#x200B;  We must continue and strengthen the culture of looking after, respecting, thanking, and helping make the jobs easier of staff like MDining, RAs, , custodians, IT, bus drivers, all the amazing staff who make this school run.  , what I dub the "Thank the Bus Driver" culture (I was stuck babysitting my Fortnite loving nephews too long send help)   We should recognize the professors and GSIs and TAs and tutoring / CSP / math lab peeps who were GOATS and rose to the challenge of the pandemic, despite inperfections. We should also recognize some professors and GSIs didn't, that's a damn shame, but it should all be noted. People show their character in the toughest of times.  &#x200B;  On that note, we should look out for each other, we should stay home if we are sick, or if we absolutely have to go to school, wear a mask. I didn't get sick this winter , thanks to the good mask wearing. We should continue to improve our habits so that we don't overcrowd Bdubs during lockdown during a pandemic COME ONNN  Finally but very important, we do need to look after our environment more. We need to try and eat less meat and encourage the same of others. This is something I need to work on too, We need to practice in behavior to help our environment, plant trees, reserve our power sources, fall in love with sustainable cooking. This allows us to not only prolong the life of our planet, but prevent this last year from happening again as best as we can.  &#x200B;  If you have any other points you think are important, drop them down below.  &#x200B;  Thank you.
post,COVID-19,positive,A class I'm taking requires us to use a certain program that's only compatible on PC's, and since I have a Mac I have to use the program through Virtual Sites and it's sooo slow and laggy and takes forever to complete an assignment. I went to the Fishbowl to print something the other day and wondered if we're allowed to use the computers there? (assuming I'd sanitize my workspace before and after), is anyone around enforcing it? Does anyone know if I'd have to reserve a computer or could I just go at random times and be fine?

For new incoming out-of-state or international students:  The Michigan Flyer-AirRide is a bus service offering daily round trips between AA and DTW. They are the most convenient and economical way to get to and from the airport. They are very reliable, clean, and comfortable as well. Highly recommend them.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi everybody! I am a junior in high school considering applying to Michigan, and was wondering if anybody had any insights to the Sports Management program. I‚Äôm fairly confident I want to major in Sports Management, but am concerned about job prospects, as it is a very niche degree. If anybody could share their experience with the Sports Management program at Michigan that‚Äôd be awesome!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Check out this information from the School of Kinesiology's website [here.](https://www.kines.umich.edu/academics/sport-management/undergraduate) It might answer most of your questions.  > Our graduates work in the front offices of the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and MLS; with professional sports teams like the Detroit Red Wings, New York Mets, and Milwaukee Bucks; within agencies like Creative Artists Agency, Wasserman, and Endeavor; and with industry-leading organizations like ESPN, the NCAA, The New York Times, Nike, and many more.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I always thought sports management was a money-grabbing degree from the university with 0 career prospects. Why not instead major in something like statstics, mathematics, law, marketing, etc and try to get into the sports field? I knew someone that did a sports management degree and a writing minor. Ended up trying to find marketing/writing jobs and I think will end up going to grad school with a more marketing focus.
post,New Student,positive,Hi guys. I was just accepted by umich as a transfer student. I plan to major in CS, and have a few questions on that if someone is willing to help:  1. Is it likely to enroll in the ULCS courses you want? I know that there is a 2-ULCS-per-semester limit and usually long waiting lists. 2. How is the teaching quality of the CS classes in general? This probably varies much among classes, but I transferred from a college with small class sizes and was kinda unsure about things in a big school like umich. 3. Do you have to be super competitive to get research opportunities with the CS faculties? I assume that there are only a few spots available but a lot of people applying.  Thank you so much!
comment,New Student,positive,1) there are some really popular classes that may be hard to get if you're a 2nd-year student, but usually, it's not so bad.  2) Some ULCS are really open-ended so it can feel like your thrown into darkness but for the most part the structure is good. Instructors are pretty active on piazza and students are really helpful so I wouldn't worry too much about getting help in ULCS. However, the case with core classes like 281 is different (worse) in terms of OH.  3) Nope it's actually not like that lol. I'm also surprised but it's much easier to get research than I thought.
post,Class,negative,Just finish one of my math midterm exams,  the grade mean and median are much lower compared to last semester and it won't be curved. Wondering if this kind of thing happens a lot? I just feel it is quite unfair for those who choose to take the course this semester instead of last one.
comment,Class,positive,I agree, it does seem unfair. In one of my other classes, the professor told us our midterm average was the highest he's ever seen. Hopeful there will be some kind of adjustment for courses negatively impacted by this.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello, I hope you are doing well. I recently found out that I was recommended for admission by the graduate committee on the application status page of my UofM account. However, I did not receive any emails confirming my acceptance. Is it safe to assume that I have been admitted to the university or are there still other steps that need to be taken?  I‚Äôd really appreciate your feedback as I‚Äôd love to break the good news to my family but I want to be a 100% sure that I‚Äôm in.  Thanks in advance
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôd email the grad coordinator for your department, they can help you figure out your status
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UM has a somewhat unusual structure for most graduate programs: while the individual department‚Äôs admissions committees do the applications review and ‚Äúrecommend admissions,‚Äù technically, the Rackham School of Graduate Studies, which is a separate ‚Äúcollege,‚Äù does the official admissions. They do the final due diligence on your case. I don‚Äôt know exactly what it consists of, but it includes things like obtaining you final official transcript, etc.  Did your initial email contain instructions to accept or turn down the offer on WolverineAccess? If yes, just take that step whenever you are ready to make your decision. If you accept, Rackham will tell you if they need any additional paperwork from you to confirm your official admission status. If there were no instructions, you can still log into WA portal, see whether there is an accept/decline option there.  Whatever your concerns are, though, the grad coordinator for your department can answer all your questions.

post,Class,negative,I heard that the EECS 485 midterm today had similar Crabster difficulties to the EECS 370 midterm last semester. Why is UMich still using Crabster if it consistently doesn't work?

comment,Class,negative,"stop trying to make crabster happen" -- regina george
comment,Class,positive,I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why the department has to keep reinventing the wheel with all these different exam delivery methods. Are Gradescope and Canvas perfect? No, but at least they are consistent and way more reliable than some last minute cobbled together solution like Crabster.   If this was the first semester we were fully online, these issues could be somewhat excused. The department had an entire Spring/Summer to standardize this stuff but still you have classes with different exam delivery methods.
comment,Class,neutral,I believe it‚Äôs up to professors‚Äô discretion on how to proctor exams (canvas/gradescope/crabster/whatever) so I imagine the profs for 485 thought it would be fixed after last semester or smth?

post,Social,positive,This years been tough, so I'm planning a road trip (covid safe) for once finals are over. I'm thinking about going west towards the grand canyon/national parks over there, but have no set plans yet. Does anyone have suggestions for great trips they have gone on or want to do? I'm thinking about going for 2-3 weeks, and really I just want a fun adventure. Looking for recommendations please
comment,Social,positive,If you make it out to California, highly highly recommend seeing Yosemite. It‚Äôs pretty amazing to see in person, just make sure you get a park pass in advance because they get reserved really quickly.  Also try to go before fire season, that area of CA tends to get really smoky late july to early september.  Some other things to see if you drive through CA are the Golden Gate, Muir Woods monument, Mt Diablo/Mt tam, Big Sur, sequoia, kings canyon, and Joshua Tree. Some are easier to get to than others, like Big Sur is way outta the way, but just some more options.
comment,Social,positive,I live in San Diego and believe it or not, every year I drive back and forth between Michigan and california. Always love going through Utah and Colorado. The only unfortunate thing is that from Ann Arbor to Denver is super boring. Literally just 1000 miles of corn and nothing else but once you head west of Denver, it‚Äôs beautiful all the way to Los Angeles. Man I remember driving on the strip in Las Vegas on March 18th 2020 and being the only car... was like a scene from a movie
comment,Social,positive,I‚Äôm from Arizona, and if you end up in the area, I strongly suggest Sedona, I personally enjoyed it even more than the Grand Canyon.
comment,Social,positive,Hot take: Grand Tetons > Yellowstone. Yellowstone is still very worth seeing, I just liked the Grand Tetons area better personally. Mt. Rushmore and Devil‚Äôs Tower are also relatively quick stops, on the way
comment,Social,negative,I'd do southern route down to New Orleans then up through Texas. I'm more of a food and culture tourist than parks and nature. I'd hit up the nationall WWII museum in NO and then stop by NASA in Houston. See some cool shit in Austin. Tacos in Dallas. Then go from there.
comment,Social,positive,Without a doubt I would highly recommend you go to Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. They are adjacent to each other and they are absolutely awe inspiring.
comment,Social,positive,West is best! Honestly, you can't go wrong with any National Park out there: Black Canyon Of The Gunnison, Moab, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Zion, and the Grand Canyon are all amazing (get a National Parks pass, it'll be cheaper). Yosemite is my favorite but I'm not sure if you'll be going that far west.
comment,Social,positive,If you go to Yellowstone and have mroe time to spare, head on out further west to the pacific NW. (Western Oregon and Washington). In my admittedly biased opinion, it is the most beautiful part of this country, and there is so much to do and see. Hit the ski slopes in the Cascades, go explore the Olympic National Park, hike along the Oregon coast, wander around in Portland and Seattle, etc. I'd suggest this more June onwards than May though, area's still a little rainy in May. So if it's a May trip, the SW part of the country may be a better choice.
comment,Social,neutral,Last summer I went on a trip from Michigan up through the UP, to badlands, glacier, down to Zion, Bryce, arches, up through the Rockies, back to Michigan. 2 weeks ish. Message me if you want any tips!

comment,Social,positive,I‚Äôve been to the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Sequoia/Kings Canyon and Joshua Tree out west. Driving through Death Valley was great, and if you leave close to closing time, you can pull off the road at night and have some of the best star views I‚Äôve ever seen. Grand Canyon is a good ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs cool‚Äù spot. Joshua Tree has a cool path you can walk along and see the different plants and wildlife in the park. Sequoia was probably the best overall experience of the four imo, because there‚Äôs a lot of cooks things to see and pictures/history to look at.

comment,COVID-19,positive,[For reference, here are the details MSU released earlier in the week about their plan for fall.](https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2021_community_letters/2021-03-05-fall-semester-announcement.html?utm_campaign=standard-promo&utm_source=msutwitter-post&utm_medium=social) I don't claim to have any inside info but am expecting something similar from UM. Definitely agree with what u/Cool_Story_Bra said, there will be a lot of qualifiers to whatever is announced.
comment,COVID-19,positive,My bet's on some kind of hyper-hybrid semester for Fall 2021. For classes that require in-person components (i.e. STEM lab sections, STAMPS), in-person instruction will be emphasized. For classes that have (mostly) had an easier time transitioning instruction to a virtual format, such as LSA's humanities and social sciences classes, online instruction will be offered for students who don't WANT the in-person instruction, for one reason or another.  Either way, I don't think tomorrow's announcement will be anything definitive; expect a lot of "we'll cross that bridge when we get there" lingo.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,My Department has heavily hinted at in person with masks to be the framework they‚Äôre planning for
post,COVID-19,positive,I got so emotional when reading the comment from u/maizeandspoons to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/m2iac5/happy_one_year_anniversary_of_being_kicked_out_of/) (quoted below). I think it would be a great idea for everyone to recollect the scene in which you were informed the stay-at-home order from U-M one year ago.  >I feel like this is going to be one of those "Where were you when..." situations.   >   >For me, I was in class when this happened.   >   >it was a smaller discussion-style class with maybe 10 people in it, in the basement of Lane Hall. We all got the email at the same time (professor included), and spent five minutes in a confusing jumbled mess of questions back-and-forth. My professor then giggled, and said: "Well, guess I'll see y'all in two weeks!"   >   >I just looked it up and she doesn't even work at UMich anymore.  EDIT: Thanks for co-creating these reflections and memories! They are precious human emotions. ‚ù§Ô∏è
comment,COVID-19,negative,In the middle of a long class session where the professors spent the first half deflecting questions about taking class online and saying they‚Äôd figure it out ‚Äúif‚Äù it happened and insisting that unlikely.  We just let them keep going for another 20m or so while we whispered with each other before someone finally told them ‚Äúuh no this is literally officially confirmed now‚Äù and they just had this look of horror they‚Äôd have to move online.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,In West Hall for a discussion session. I went to the bathroom right before class and checked my phone after washing my hands. Every single group chat was freaking out. I read the email and literally felt like I was tripping for a minute. Lowkey expected it but still felt unreal to see them actually announce it.   Went back to my classroom where everyone, including the Professor, was gathered in a huddle in the centre of the class. We spent the next 40 minutes just chatting together, trying to make sense of everything going on. I walked out of that classroom that day and I haven't been in one since.

comment,COVID-19,positive,I remember leaving work that Friday with several bags of stuff from my office. At the time we thought we'd be working from home for maybe 2-3 months. One faculty member said 'See you in January' which generated a lot of nervous laughter...still waiting to get back to campus.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was in the Lloyd study lounge. The energy in the air was palpable‚Äîanxiousness tinged with a bit of excitement, as we waited for that fateful email, foolishly hoping for what we expected to be a few days off from our classes.  No one was really getting any work done and the excited whispers turned into jestful banter as folks stood up and talked to each other across the room. ‚ÄúWoah. State is going home. We‚Äôve gotta be next‚Äù, ‚ÄúThey have to cancel class for the next few days right? I mean really theres no way around it..‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you really think they‚Äôre kicking us out?‚Äù,  ‚ÄúHow long do you think we‚Äôll be gone?‚Äù  We waited and waited, and eventually got what we were wanting. That fateful email and a couple days off from class. People jumped from their chairs in excitement and disbelief. ‚ÄúPack your shit boys‚Äù someone said to a room of laughing oblivious fools.    If only we could‚Äôve kept waiting.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,The UgLi. Seems fitting with everything that has gone wrong on campus since then like the spiders
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Praying my midterm in 2 hours would get cancelled (it did get pushed back a week!)
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was finally sitting down in an absolutely packed State street chipotle with like 7 of my friends, going ‚Äúyooooo my prof just cancelled homework for this week!!‚Äù right before I saw the university email.  we all partied that night. a few of us were seniors; I never saw ‚Äòem in person again.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was in my dorm room at Martha Cook. I ran around the next two hours trying to see all of my friends because my dad and sister were coming to get me. My older sister got notice a few days prior and went to school farther East, so they were driving back from getting her when we got word.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I was in the chem building. I‚Äôd just left a lab and was saying goodbye to my lab partner before I walked to the bus stop. We both got the email at the same time and immediately started talking about it. Tbh it was a shitty, anticlimactic way to end senior year.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I was at home in quarantine recovering from my first round of Covid-19.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I was at my research job on campus. I saw the announcement on Twitter and said to the other student in the office ‚Äúoh my god, they cancelled classes.‚Äù We talked about how fucked up everything was for maybe ten minutes, and then I just spent the remaining two hours of my shift refreshing Twitter and growing more and more sad at everything happening.   I remember talking to my supervisor at that job the next day...we thought there would be no problem continuing to work in the office because it was ‚Äúnaturally socially distanced.‚Äù I figured I‚Äôd just spend quarantine in Ann Arbor with my friends.   Then, of course, the office closes, my work pauses and I have to go home because I can‚Äôt afford to buy food without it. Those first three months or so were awful.   It‚Äôs been a difficult year, y‚Äôall. I know it feels like this will go on forever, but the end is in sight. Please stay safe and take care of yourselves.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Getting my last haircut.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I was in my last in person class meeting, with a class almost entirely consisting of seniors. Needless to say it was surreal collectively realizing our college experience was over very suddenly.
comment,COVID-19,negative,Class had just ended at the MLB when everyone began talking about the announcement. It didn't really feel shocking at all as it felt like most other schools had already started cancelling classes and moving things online so it was really more of a matter of **when** Michigan would follow than if.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was on my way to work at East Quad and ran into a few of my friends in the dorms. I almost skipped work because my head was reeling and I wanted to stay to discuss with them. I ended up going, and it was a very emotional day behind the desk at East Quad.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was in the library on north with one of my closest friends and we were working on a modeling project. I remember talking about COVID and how MSU had cancelled classes, and how we figured Michigan would too. And then the news came out, and it was this surreal experience. We were happy; we saw it as a break, but we didn't even know what was ahead. I saw a lot of people for the last time that day/week, and that's a sobering thought. Probably a day I won't ever forget.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I know you're probably more interested in current students' perspectives, but thought I would offer mine.  One year ago is also when my (now former) company announced ***only*** the Chicago office, where I was based, would be working from home for the next two days. Over the weekend that extended to all offices ***for two weeks***.  Even before this announcement, I knew there was absolutely no way the two week lockdowns that were proposed almost country-wide would actually be the case. Honestly I expected this to drastically change life for at least a year. I was reading WSJ articles every day like a hawk, and closely following the John Hopkins data. Here is a comment I left on a WSJ article about covid in February 2020 (which got no likes and many stupid replies). The article was written when there were less than 100 cases in the U.S:  *I have to imagine that the fatality data is realistically so much lower than what is being reported (\~2-5%, varying by country). There are probably so many people with the disease that have not been confirmed, because their symptoms are only mild. It seems like most healthy individuals (particularly those under 50) that contract the virus are experiencing mild flu symptoms.¬† It is, however, remarkably contagious. I expect it to spread throughout the U.S.*  My only regret is that I didn't buy VOO or SPY puts in February. I knew what was about to happen. I did, however, put all my money into the markets by mid-march when the drop was almost at its nadir. At least I made some money on the way up!
comment,COVID-19,neutral,SMTD, music theory class. Got the email right at the end of class, the entire practice building was going wild. People were wondering if they still had to fulfill their senior recital requirement, which in the end was waived for that year. It was insane.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I was already at home. I had been reading a lot of news during the first week of March, and was starting to see the writing on the wall. I ate in a dining hall on the 10th, and I just remember my mind racing the entire time I was in there, huge alarm bells going off while I tried to carry out this routine. All those shared surfaces and close quarters, before we knew much of *anything* about how the virus spread or what it was doing to people. I went back home after that meal with the intent not to return to campus until the following week at least, thinking I would need a few days if it just turned out to be irrational anxiety. So yeah...just sitting there in my apartment, already rifling through news and social media, watching it all come crashing down piece by piece
comment,COVID-19,positive,Was in a study carrel at Hatcher. Good times.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I transferred to UofM from WCC last semester, and I had just finished a microbiology lab taught by an infection preventionist at the University of Michigan Hospital when we all received news that WCC was suspending on-campus operations for the rest of the semester.  That class got more and more fun as the pandemic ramped up, and we were all pretty amused about where we were at the time that announcement was made.
comment,COVID-19,positive,In an EECS class getting ready to take an exam. Rather than talking about the exam our class was discussing the shutdown. We took the exam then went home.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Studying in the Union. My first reaction was to be excited about having classes completely cancelled for the next two days lol
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I woke up from a nap between classes üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
comment,COVID-19,negative,I had just hopped on the bursley-baits bus at the Rackham stop. I've never seen so many strangers talking to each other on the bus before when we all got the email and were trying to figure everything out
comment,COVID-19,negative,I just knew something was coming and I decided to just bag classes on that Wednesday, sleep in, and wait to hear from the admin (which, of course, I unfortunately did). In the few days between spring break and cancellation, my profs where all going over how they'd handled a pause to in person classes but I don't think anyone expected that to be our last day in a classroom.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was in ME240, my last class of the day. At the time we were really excited
comment,COVID-19,neutral,South quad dining hall. I looked at my phone and I texted someone ‚Äúis the world ending?‚Äù
comment,COVID-19,positive,In Trotter, studying with a friend.  Haven‚Äôt seen him in person since then :(
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was walking to my friend's apartment to pick up my wallet I left behind when I saw the news on my phone. I was really happy because I had a class I didn't do the reading for later that day and we were already making party plans a minute after the announcement. My dad called me a few minutes later telling me that I should go home but I didn't want to. My mom called later that night saying that I *had* to go home...  I said bye to my friends while they were getting into an Uber before my parents picked me up later that night and the rest is history...  I came back two days later to take the rest of my shit from East Quad (wearing masks this time lol) and my roommate left a note on my desk saying hopefully we'd be back soon. I really believed we would.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I distinctly remember my housemates all walking out of our rooms and into the common area (part time seniors, we were checked out of school) and thinking ‚Äúsweet no school we can go to Ricks and Main Street and just ride out the last month of school‚Äù with the people we will never see again. (Obviously, this was an irresponsible thought, but it was a shit show those first few days)   Then reality sunk in about ten minutes later and we felt helpless about how all the things that are supposed to happen in the last 2 months of your senior year are not going to happen (graduation, bar crawls, walking through the fountain, your final class) even just saying goodbye to friends from across the world you will never see again was not going to happen.   It takes time to process all of that and it just happened instantly.  Many of my friends still talk about the things they wish they could have done before the email came out. I guess it goes to show you to live every day like your last.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,On a backpacking trip in Argentina on study abroad. I left on the trip and then  four days later when I got service again I was being sent home
comment,COVID-19,negative,I was leaving work. It was supposed to be the job that would land me a full time offer but they unexpectedly pulled the plug on that plan. That job broke my heart harder than boys have
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Oh my gosh, thank you for being so inspired by my comment! It's so wild to reflect back on how different the world was.   In case anyone wants an additional juicy detail about "a year of COVID memories", on March 13 (the first confirmed case in Washtenaw),  I panic-cried and my boyfriend and I made a blanket fort in our apartment living room. <3
comment,COVID-19,positive,In the basement of the Ugli where I was working with my teammates on a lab report for a lab class. Skipped the only class I had on that day not knowing that it would be my last non-COVID in-person class ever here lol
comment,COVID-19,neutral,EECS 351 discussion
comment,COVID-19,negative,I had an exam in Mason Hall that day.  All of my classes beforehand consisted entirely of my classmates and I freaking out and wondering why we were still in person when there was a confirmed case so nearby.  It wasn't until after the exam that I saw the announcement. When I told my deskmate, she jumped in the air and screamed with joy--I think she was exhausted and thinking we would just be doing class in our pajamas for a few weeks.  In contrast, I was pretty miserable about it, but mostly because I knew I would hate online classes. I didn't realize how bad it was about to get or how much of my life was going to be spent waiting for it to be over.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was in the union basement with a friend, there was collective chatter about it among all of the groups as soon as the email was sent out. Overall a strange aura in the building at the time, just everyone feeling uncertainty and concern. Or maybe that's me projecting lol
comment,COVID-19,negative,I was in a lab on north campus when we all got the email. Everyone kinda just looked at each other and said "oh shit."
comment,COVID-19,positive,ME 211 Office hours in GG Brown. It was funny, we all got the email before the professor did
comment,COVID-19,negative,I was in my dorm in Mojo when I got the email. I heard lots of shouting in the hallways.  That morning, I learned that 2 of my recommendation letters for a cross-campus transfer hadn't submitted. I originally planned to talk with my recommenders on Thursday. But when I got the stay-at-home order at 4 PM, I made a mad dash across campus to get the letters before everything closed for the day. Then, I sprinted back across campus to turn them in before the school's office closed at 5. I was so out of breath lol, and that was the last time I saw anyone in my research lab or my dorm. So crazy
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was in my 6-9pm lab for EECS 215. My lab partners and I were continuously refreshing our phones waiting for the email because we had just watched MSU and several other big names schools close earlier that day and in the week. After they sent the announcement out I got an email from my Astro professor letting us know they would still be in the lecture hall tomorrow and we were welcome to come watch it live but it would also be recorded. Don't think they understood the purpose of going remote.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I think I was sitting in Hatcher preparing for my 280 midterm, which was supposed to be in person. The view was great that day. I think the 280 staff did some super emergency changing up and didn‚Äôt cancel it. Luckily for me I got a haircut the day before.   Less than two weeks later I flew 16 hours home.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I was in am engineering class, and we ended up taking that professor to Bursley for dinner.
comment,COVID-19,positive,At WCC taking calc (I dual-enrolled to get some credits done), was checking my phone during class and saw some news about it spreading and decided I would not be going to Umich starting that day. Funnily enough they cancelled all classes an hour after I got home lol
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I was in East Quad finishing a Spanish class. Walked home completely bewildered talking to my parents about if I should come home or not. I went home probably about a week after that.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I may have jinxed it, honestly. I was in the USB in my lab just am hour before, talking to my group mates about how there's only two cases, there's no way they'll shut it down/go online. My GSI walks past our table and overheard us, and said "theres no way to know they aren't doing any testing at all for all we know there could b someone in this room who has it", then when we left I was telling my group mates, see you guys next week! I get home from the bus and open my email and bam. Everything's online, it's real.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I had work from 6am-noon that day catering a fairly large event- we were all reeling, as Harvard had gotten shut down the day before. I was so exhausted after work that I went to my next class for half an hour, and then slept at home... headed back out with some snacks to meet my friends at a film lab (we watched Dr. Strange) and right before it started, we got the email- I had to tell the prof what was happening, and we all decided to watch the movie anyways. Then I went to my last in-person meeting with my therapist, and celebrated a free weekend with my friends and now ex.  So much has changed since.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,In the middle of a big psych lecture. So much has changed since then, both in school and in the world
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I was in a discussion section in East hall. We all saw the email as soon as we got out, walking out of East with everyone talking about ‚Äúwoah, no more class for two weeks!‚Äù We were all confused but excited at that point. If only we‚Äôd known.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I was in my sociology discussion on Wednesday the 11th when my GSI told us this might be our last in person meeting, and that our hospital had two covid patients. I really underestimated the effect the virus would have, so I didn't worry about it much until then. Leaving class that day, I had this distinct alternate reality feeling that the world was going to change and would not be similar for quite some time. I got the cancellation email later that night (and cancellation of my physics exam at that!) Looking back though, I can't believe it's been a year already.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I had an advising appointment ten minutes after the announcement came out and my advisor went to shake my hand as we were meeting for the first time and said ‚Äúoops! I forgot!‚Äù  We talked about how weird everything was and wished each other a good two weeks away. The only other times I‚Äôve met him have been over zoom
comment,COVID-19,positive,I was still at MSU, and we closed a few days before UofM. I was sitting down at the Chemistry building, finishing my orgo lab prelab assignment about half an hour before class. I checked my phone and boom, everyone pack your bags. Within 5 minutes, pretty much the whole building was empty with students and staff pouring out the door to go celebrate. I distinctly remember a guy talking about how he was gonna go to Harper's to celebrate. I was somewhat relieved that I got to go home, but also very anxious because I knew there was no way we were coming back to campus any time soon. That was also the last day I was able to play basketball in a gym, which I miss beyond measure.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Cramming for an exam in OH. Prof gets the email and just goes ‚Äúwell guys the exam just got moved.‚Äù Even if it stole my graduation at least covid saved my grade in that one class.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I literally don‚Äôt remember. I have vague memories of that week but I‚Äôve pretty much tried to block out the memories
comment,COVID-19,positive,Getting ready to take an eecs 280 midterm on google sheets. Yes google sheets!

comment,COVID-19,positive,lol it was literally a movie, I swear. I did my undergrad at UM Flint and i was studying in one of our study commons area. One of my friends was like hey, MSU just closed for like 2 full weeks and are planning to go online for the semester. And I was like ????? Gurl bye, there‚Äôs no way we would do that lolol. And EVERYONE started talking about it throughout the rest of my day (that was like at 11 AM ish). I finally go to my last class of the day, and it‚Äôs a REALLY small class so we‚Äôre all talking about it ofc before class starts, and the prof joins in too. Apparently, they were informed by the University to start planning to go online since Monday (today was Wednesday). Anyway, we told her MSU was online now and she said we wouldn‚Äôt go online unless UM Ann Arbor does. Flash forward like 30 min, we‚Äôre now in the middle of class discussing class material, and two students BARGE in our room (they knew the prof really well) and go ‚ÄúBye guys, we‚Äôre officially online‚Äù. And the whole class started freaking out, we didn‚Äôt even believe it lol we were all looking thru our emails and stuff. Finally, someone went on Twitter and saw Schlissel‚Äôs announcement that UM Ann Arbor is now officially online. We later got emails at the end of class with Flint and Dearborn campuses being online too. We literally couldn‚Äôt believe it lol I literally didn‚Äôt go back to campus after that day, and all of it was crazy honestly

post,COVID-19,positive,I just got an email that pretty much said "I know there is a mental health day the week of March 22, so I need you to sign up to come in outside of class time so I can still teach you this thing you absolutely have to know going forward"  Like, that completely defeats the purpose of a mental health day. The professors with classes on Tuesdays should have planned around this rather than just moving the work around. I'm lucky enough that I have Thursdays free and it's no big deal for me to come in another day, but what about the students who have busier schedules? Work? It's a bunch of annoying nonsense.  &#x200B;  On the other hand, one of my professors canceled class on Wednesday so that awesome of them.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Big props to the professors who actually don't hold class or assign activities on a wellness day/week.  inb4 "ThEy ShOuLd HaVe JuSt CaLlEd iT a sTuDy DaY", the disregarding of professors and programs scheduling activities on wellness days for many students, and subsequent flaming because "yOu'Re nOt SpEsHuL, We'Re AlL bUsY!"
comment,COVID-19,neutral,MCDB 306?
comment,COVID-19,negative,From a limited sample size of professors (n=4), so take this with a grain of salt: they didn't even know the mental health day was a thing until a week before it was scheduled... So they likely planned their syllabus without knowing.... :|
post,Sports,negative,Hello fellow Wolverines,  What was your experience like with the Maize Rage? As a first generation college student, I never grew up cheering for any particular college team and never went to any of the games. Love to hear your stories at the Maize Rage.  Best, bigwolverinefan2023
comment,Sports,positive,I never had season tickets to basketball, but I did pick up a couple of tickets on the secondary market from other students, but the Maize Rage was always a fun experience. All the student sections for the major sports are fun at Michigan and I recommend that if you are a sports fan to try and be a part of the student sections for Football, Basketball, and Hockey at least once, and if you like soccer then check out the Michigan Ultras as well.
comment,Sports,negative,the main problem with the maize rage is that if you don‚Äôt get there super early, you get put in the upper deck, which fucking sucks. It‚Äôs really a big difference in the atmosphere.
comment,Sports,positive,I love football but college basketball is the best sport to watch live by far. 20 minutes of constant action (and scoring, unlike soccer) a short break, then 20 more minutes of constant action.  Overall games never take more than two hours of my time, so I can actually do other stuff that same day.  Definitely worth the rock bottom price of admission.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Hi folks, I'm a current LSA student that's considering applying for a Ross Business Minor. Because I'm a transfer student, I don't know much about how competitive the business minor is or what I should/shouldn't include in my essay responses. Curious to know others opinions/feedback and any advice that you may have for me as an interested student. Thanks!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Sup, I was in the business minor, hope this helps. The acceptance rate is ~50% but I would keep in mind that many people don‚Äôt put a lot of effort into the application so you asking this question here shows an initiative which is a great start. Don‚Äôt know much about the transfer angle but you do have to submit a resume along with essays. Get your resume reviewed by as many people as possible (feel free to dm me)! You don‚Äôt have to take every suggestion but having as many eyes on it as possible is always good.   In terms of the essays, they‚Äôre short and make you choose your words carefully. The first question about why you want to be in the minor is probably more important and I would really do your research about what classes and resources are available. Simply saying ‚ÄúI want to be a math major who can learn about the business world‚Äù won‚Äôt cut it, you should think about how it would benefit you in school and your career. Obviously, you might not have your whole life figured out and that‚Äôs ok! For me, the business minor was about understanding how organizations and people work, not just the computer I was programming on. I was also excited about the opportunity to be with fellow business-curious peers across majors to bounce ideas off of and learn about their interests. What I‚Äôm saying is that your essay doesn‚Äôt have to outline your career path in detail but how the skills you gain from the classes you take will help open new doors and create meaningful relationships.   The introduction essay is a bit wonky and I hated writing it lol. I think I just wrote the first things that came to my mind, just be yourself and don‚Äôt come off as unapproachable. Remember, they have your resume so no need to list off your accomplishments, I‚Äôm pretty sure Gordon Ramsay was mentioned in my essay üòÇ.  Lastly it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you don‚Äôt get in. It‚Äôs competitive and you can always take b school classes as a non b school student. Tbh one of the best perks of being in the minor is reserving Ross study rooms lol. Best of luck my friends
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I don't even know if people in the job market care about my Major anymore, much less a minor, and I deadass graduated only 3 years ago  Accounting300 and Finance300 are good classes to know, as they fundamentally give you a numerical way to analyze a business' performance,but if you're really interested, you could probably learn everything you really need to know online through a MOOC. Easier if you get credit for it though
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I'm in the exact same position. Would be great to know.

post,COVID-19,positive,Exactly one year ago we were kicked out of campus. Trying to survive while being separated from our fun and inspiring peers is definitely challenging. But we will come out stronger when this all ends because we have developed strategies and resilience from having to navigate through tremendous crisis. One thing to look forward to is that we will be closer to each other than ever before!  Shout out to all my fellow Wolverines who have made it THIS far!!
comment,COVID-19,negative,Pain
comment,COVID-19,positive,I feel like this is going to be one of those "Where were you when..." situations.   For me, I was in class when this happened.   it was a smaller discussion-style class with maybe 10 people in it, in the basement of Lane Hall. We all got the email at the same time (professor included), and spent five minutes in a confusing jumbled mess of questions back-and-forth. My professor then giggled, and said: "Well, guess I'll see y'all in two weeks!"   I just looked it up and she doesn't even work at UMich anymore.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Only if I had said my proper goodbyes then knowing that I would lose most of those wonderful friends I had back then; drifted away with my best friend since and am not on speaking terms now :(
comment,COVID-19,positive,I just transferred to the University of Michigan. Hopefully, I will be able to meet my Umich friends that I made online, and you guys reconnecting with your friends after we beat the pandemic.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I‚Äôm really sad that I‚Äôm graduating this semester and will never get to go back to be a student on campus again :(
post,COVID-19,negative,When you first filled out Bluequeue back in December, did you get a confirmation email? Just wondering if I was an idiot who didn't finish the whole form at the time because I didn't get a confirmationüòÖ   I recently got vaccinated elsewhere, so I re-filled out Bluequeue today saying I got the vaccine, and I received a confirmation email afterwards.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I don‚Äôt seem to have gotten an email, but I definitely did get a screen at the end saying ‚Äúthank you for completing x survey!
comment,COVID-19,neutral,They changed the system a few weeks in: initially, they didn‚Äôt send confirmation emails, but started doing it at some point.
post,Housing,positive,So, I know that housing contracts say that we HAVE to stay / at least pay until our leases end (late July in this case) but I won‚Äôt need to live here for the last month. Is there ANY way to end the contract early without paying the final month? Does housing have some sort of COVID or Exception policy? Any advice would be appreciated!
comment,Housing,negative,They have been willing to make exceptions for Northwood informally, doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask sooner than later
comment,Housing,positive,It's definitely worth asking! I had a similar situation (before COVID) and *had* to pay for the last month even though I moved out already.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Where can I find study spots (on campus or not) that are open late? I usually work until 1am minimum and it‚Äôs making me super stressed just staying at home and working.  I do have a car, and a bike so I don‚Äôt mind having to drive a bit out, if necessary.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,There are buildings on north that are open 24/7 for engineering students (7am-midnight for LSA; your MCard will stop working to get in at midnight but no one's gonna kick you out) and parking that opens at 5 pm
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I think most halls on central have study spots and are open 24/7 (the non-residential areas).
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Ik that Ross is open till 10 but I don‚Äôt know of anywhere open past that
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,If you‚Äôre in engineering, I love GG Brown, and all north campus buildings are open 24/7 for CoE students.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I guess the best bet would be any of your friends' home haha
post,Sports,neutral,How long does it usually take for season tickets to sell out?
comment,Sports,positive,It's literally like only six hours in and my friends started telling me they could not get the ice hockey and basketball tickets anymore. I am asking as a current freshman who has no idea how Michigan sports tickets work: do the tickets always sell out so fastÔºü Or are they really trying their best to "limit capacity" with all the rage from the pandemic?
comment,Sports,neutral,I heard basketball and hockey are already sold out
post,Degree,neutral,Has anyone that applied for FALL 21 got their decision yet or know when we should be expecting them??
post,COVID-19,positive,Edit: There is no double standard. It seems u of m has developed 2 different solutions to stop the spread of covid to best suit the 2 different situations. The solution implemented in hospitals is a scientifically motivated one and is safe. The same is true for the undergrad policy, it just does it a different way.  I will leave the post here in case you want to know why I was wrong or had similar questions. Just know that all the conclusions below this line are wrong. _____________________________________________________   I wanted to bring attention to what I thought was an interesting double standard in UofM's covid policy. I am not a doctor and the last time I took any health related science class was highschool so view my conclusion (that a double standard exists) with that in mind. But to the fullest extent of my knowledge, I do believe the statements I am making are true.  Umich undergrads are required to be tested weekly if they have in person classes or want to use university facilities. The typical demographic of a u of m undergrad is a young adult with little to no medical problems that cause additional risk for covid. Undergrads primarily interact with other undergrads who are low risk also, but some undergrads are at risk and some undergrads interact with older, more vulnerable populations. UofM's conclusions from this was that it was safest practice to test undergrads weekly to prevent the spread of covid to at risk peoples. I will contrast this with their hospital policy.  At this point most hospital workers have gotten the vaccine, but not all of them. Many hospital workers interact with patients who are immunocompromised. (Cancer patients, people recovering from surgery, etc.) It was recently made know to me that hospital workers(My source worked at Mott's) are not required to be tested even if they have not been vaccinated, and are not required to be tested unless they show symptoms. They fill out the responsiblue screening daily like students did first semester still, but no weekly covid test is required.  This is the conclusions part that you should consider for yourself. My word is not any form of authority and should not be taken as one.  It seems that the danger of a hospital workers getting covid and potentially spreading it to not only temporarily immunocompromised patients who do not have the vaccine or other employees who do not have the vaccine is much greater than risk of undergrad students passing the virus to at risk people, who they come into contact with much less frequently than hospital workers. There could be some sort of herd immunity at the hospital that I am unaware of, or some other factor I have never heard of that makes hospitals very unlikely to spread the virus, but I have not heard anything like that yet (Not meaning that it isn't there, but that I don't know if it is). Assuming that the hospital environment is comparable to other environments, it seems that either excessive precautions are being taken for undergrad students or that insufficient precautions are being taken in hospitals.  If you are educated about this feel free to leave a comment clarifying this for me and all the people like me who are in the dark. I will edit the post as necessary to correct any accidental misinformation.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I would argue that it's a different standard, not a double standard.  Hospital workers are wearing PPE when they interact with patients. Always. College students are far more likely to be wearing a store-bought (and less effective) mask, and that's it.   Further, a lot of college students are living with lots of other people, and they are presumably not wearing masks at all there. Hospital workers probably also mostly aren't wearing masks at home, but they are far less likely to live in a group setting like a dorm or coop where the virus could spread like wildfire.
post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Hello everyone ! I was just put in the waitlist for the FCVC summer fellowship and I was wondering , did anyone experience getting of the waitlist before for this program  ?

post,Miscellaneous,neutral,I know they give you a t-shirt when you declare a major, but is there a place where they sell major t-shirts?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Depending upon your college/major, some are on sale upstairs at the MDen. Otherwise, I'd recommend trying Underground Printing, as I heard that sometimes they can add a major to a shirt (that was as of 2018, so this could no longer be accurate).
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Some majors (and even minors) give them to you when you declare. This was when classes and advising appointments were in person, so not sure if you just don‚Äôt get one if you declare virtually.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,For ME, they are usually given out at the ASO in GG Brown. They are closed when I am usually there, and I think they might be closed for the semester :(

post,Food / Culture,positive,Hello fellow Wolverines,  I have not set foot on campus yet due to the ongoing pandemic. On social media, I see that Pizza House is one of the go-to places for pizza. What distinguishes Pizza House from its pizza competitors other than its exclusive location in A2 and East Lansing? What would you recommend ordering at Pizza House?  Best, bigwolverinefan2023
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Order: Cheesy Bread or Feta Bread, Milkshakes  Popular for: Delivery until 4 AM, Late night specials, Good location, Huge menu
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Pizza house is average at best and very overpriced.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Rip South U Pizza
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,It‚Äôs overrated and very expensive!
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Pizza house is good but it‚Äôs kind of eclipsed by Joe‚Äôs in terms of how good the pizza is.  Pizza house now is more about the experience of eating there
comment,Food / Culture,positive,It's a good basic pizza, just generally a bit better than big chains, but I don't find it outstanding, just decent. The restaurant itself is kind of nice, as you can see from their website. They have a liquor license, and a number of non-pizza items as well, good milkshakes and what not. Again, nothing spectacular, but higher end than fast food chains or budget student dining. It's a popular place for families to take UM students when they're visiting from out of town.  If you like deep dish or Chicago style pizzas, I'd recommend another restaurant, [Anthony's Gourmet Pizza](http://www.anthonysgourmet.com/), which I do think stands out, but it's not for people with a weak wallet...a large pie can run you $40-$50 depending on toppings.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,One small specific thing - if you like seafood, Pizza House has a pretty solid seafood pizza which isn‚Äôt something you get at a lot of other places
comment,Food / Culture,positive,It‚Äôs not even good. Go for Neopapalis
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Dominos is better than pizza house and cheaper. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Last time I was in A2 after many years away I ordered pizza from cottage inn, was disappointed it's no longer square...  That pizza by the slice place just west of diag isn't bad.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Nothing
comment,Food / Culture,negative,I haven‚Äôt set foot in Pizza House ever since I watched the 2018 oSU game in the Garage Bar adjacent to Pizza House. I blame that loss on Pizza House and their ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Pizza house quality is just okay, but its late night special/cravers menu is a big draw.   Jet‚Äôs in Ypsi and Buddy‚Äôs on AA-Saline are solid choices if you want to try out some spots that are popular for Detroit style pizza. Try out their all-corner pizzas with cajun crust (Jet‚Äôs) üëåüèΩ
comment,Food / Culture,positive,It‚Äôs only better than backroom pizza, maybe better than NYPD, but it‚Äôs also more expensive than either of those. Even South U tasted better if you just wanted pizza. Other than late night availability, there‚Äôs not much reason to get it over Dominos if you want American fast food pizza.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Their breadsticks are second to none.  The chipatis are good.  It's expensive.  Depending on what you want, Mani Osteria is actual pizza; Anthony's stuffed Chicago is awesome; Domino's is faster and cheaper and, despite being a chain, is pretty decent (and technically local, being HQ'd in A2)
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Neopapalis is the best pizza on campus, it‚Äôs not even close
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I used to work there. Its overpriced for what you get, good pizza is hard ti come by in general in AA (unless you like new york style or cottage inn, really?)  They really need to move a detroit style place within walking distance to downtown.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Pizza house food is gross and, as many others have pointed out, grossly overpriced as well.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Please don‚Äôt. I worked there for almost a year and it‚Äôs really not worth the price. The appeal is that it‚Äôs really big and you can almost always be seated after a night out or on a game day and slam cheesy bread with your homies. It‚Äôs literally just the availability of it really, that‚Äôs why they have a good reputation. Go to dominos and get their 2 for 5.99 deal
comment,Food / Culture,positive,A2 doesn't have good pizza besides Jets.  I grew up in the Tri-State and live in Chicago, so I might have unrealistic standards.  I'd still eat Backroom after a night at Ricks though.
post,Class,negative,Hi, does anybody know what the pass cutoff for EECS 215? I've been doing very poorly this semester and have completely fallen behind on the weekly homework and labs, but have felt good about the quizzes. I'm thinking my raw grade right now might be somewhere around a 65% on the low estimate if my quiz performance were to continue for the rest of the quizzes.
comment,Class,positive,I would recommend emailing your instructors or scheduling an appointment to discuss this. There‚Äôs no reason why they should not be willing to tell you whether or not you‚Äôre on track to pass.
comment,Class,positive,Have you asked your instructor? When I took 215 it was on a straight scale (so a 65 would be failing) but it doesn‚Äôt have the same rotating instructors. You‚Äôre really just better off asking them
post,Health / Wellness,positive,I got on the waiting list last September, and basically, they are queueing people for appointments a year out. So, I should be able to get an appointment to get tested for  ADHD in 6 months.  &#x200B;  For people who waited to finally get an appointment, how long did you have to wait before said appointment, after the wait? Was your appointment that, or next week, or later. The wait is excruciating even now lol  &#x200B;  Also, how much, if any did you have to spend? Was it insurance based (if I may ask)?  &#x200B;  Even if you're experience was not ADHD, still curious.   &#x200B;  Thank you!
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,When you say ‚Äúhere,‚Äù do you mean in Ann Arbor? Or at Michigan Medicine? A lot of what you‚Äôre asking probably varies based on the provider you‚Äôre seeing.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,My psych is [here](https://annarborpsych.com/) and while I wasn‚Äôt tested there (already had a diagnosis), I know they do testing for a few hundred. I don‚Äôt remember waiting long for an appointment. Definitely don‚Äôt wait 6 months if you can help it. ADHD sucks ass and the sooner you can get help the better
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Never went to here, but have you gone to a therapist yet? I thought I had ADHD too and mine did a preliminary exam, and I found out, it wasn't adhd, but anxiety. Symptoms of both conditions overlap.      The test would have been 2K (my insurance covered 50%) so if you have a therapist, you might want to talk to them first.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,There are other providers in the area besides U-M that may take your insurance. I know St. Joe's is a slightly shorter wait but I was able to find one in six weeks at TheraSupport and they do seem to take my insurance (U-M Blue Care Network Premier Care).   Here's a list of community providers I got from the UHS social worker.  Neuropsychology Partners  http://neuropsychologyllc.com/   Mary A. Rackham Institute https://mari.umich.edu/testing   Complete Neuropsychology Services http://annarborneuropsychologist.com/   TheraSupport, LLC http://www.trosenbaum.com/   Sullivan, Nolan and Associates, P.C. https://www.sullivanandnolan.com/testing.html   Good luck!
post,Employment,neutral,
comment,Employment,positive,They sent an email couple weeks ago saying they will go over application this week. And probably start interviewing people starts next week. But yeah, nothing else I have heard from them.
comment,Employment,neutral,They probably will especially if they have international student applying. There is no reason to do international phone call when they could just cold email people.
comment,Employment,neutral,I got an email from them yesterday about getting a further interview and those are next week so they may still be figuring out final decisions on who moves forward in the interview process

comment,Employment,negative,I also applied for the internship but still haven't heard back :( maybe I should assume that they have rejected me...
post,Sports,positive,I just got football, basketball and hockey season tickets for next year and I know I won‚Äôt be able to make all of them games, at least for hockey and basketball. So I was wondering what is the best way to sell tickets? Does Michigan have a site or is there a good third party option?
comment,Sports,neutral,Facebook class of 20XY groups, maize market, etc in my experience
post,Prospective Student,positive,Read some nightmare-ish articles about waitlists to get into required/essential CS classes. How true is it? It'd be kind of a pain to get admitted, pay that OOS Tuition, and not get into classes, or having to graduate in 5 years...
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I have not heard a lot of stories of not being able to get into what you *need* to graduate.   I have heard lots of stories of not being able to get seats in the classes or sections (instructors, time of day) you *want*. Some people choose to wait to take the class they want, which ends up causing graduation delays.   Are you coming in with transfer credits (AP, IB, dual enrollment)? Even some classes at your local community college this summer would help you boost your class standing, which helps to earn earlier registration times. (But it also causes you to start paying upper division tuition, which is more expensive, earlier.)   Objectively, registration is more stressful than a program like UIUC that strictly limits the size of its CS program by making students apply to the major as high school seniors. But it‚Äôs also a more inclusive model that allows people to switch into CS, or come into college undecided.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I arrived with two credits from high school and have had no problem getting into required CS courses. I‚Äôve had some preferred upper level electives fill up before I could register, but I‚Äôve been able to either take different ones or simply wait to take them later.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I read the article you posted. It doesn't mention Michigan specifically, but I totally understand the concern. We do have overcrowding issues at Michigan CS, but it's not as dire as it may seem.  &#x200B;  First things first: All the *required* classes are easy to get into. These are classes like EECS 280, EECS 281, EECS 370, and EECS 376 and I believe EECS 183 (though I never took it, so I can't guarantee it). I know for a fact that both EECS 280 and 281 will accept every single student who wants to take the class.   &#x200B;  The problems arise when students need to take their Upper Level CS courses. While there are always spots available in *some* courses, they may not be the ones that are considered desirable. Classes like EECS 482 (Operating Systems) and EECS 485 (Web Systems) fill up very early on. However, there are other Upper Levels that usually have spots open, so graduating should not be a concern.   &#x200B;  I'm graduating this semester and am an Instructional Aide for EECS 281, so feel free to message me with any questions you might have about CS here.  &#x200B;  Go Blue!
post,Media,neutral,
post,COVID-19,positive,Could be a form of compensation for them not hosting graduation (and saving tons of $). Giving soon-to-be grads free lifetime (or for many years) access to programs like the online library, Adobe, LinkedIn Learning/Premium, would be much appreciated (and would help us in our professional endeavors -- something the university should stand for!). Other ideas are free access to the UM Alumni Association and free football tickets (I'll be very upset if they don't do this).  Hope some of you agree with this idea and will help me pass it along to/share it with the university. (I can even share an email I've sent if anyone wants a template.) I'm not demanding they host an in-person graduation, but there's literally no reason why they can't do this...seems like the least they can do. I've been so busy with school and trying to *actually graduate* that I haven't been able to take advantage of these resources (like reading all the "cool" books the library has, taking LinkedIn Learning courses, etc).
comment,COVID-19,positive,Haha, as if the university will give you more than the bare minimum. Just wait, in a few months they‚Äôll be calling you for donations.
comment,COVID-19,positive,In relative terms I don't think they're saving "a ton" of money by not having in-person commencement ceremonies.  Alumni access to databases and software is VERY expensive, if feasible at all. Many vendors won't even negotiate alumni access.  The educational software/data market is made to give schools relatively cheap access in hopes alumni will pay market commercial rates after they graduate individually or via their firms/companies.
comment,COVID-19,positive,The U took a financial hit with covid. Fewer enrollments and way fewer on campus. This set off a stream of less revenue from tuition down to vending machines. Because of this, the the money they would have otherwise spent on Spring Commencement is probably needed to pay for other essential stuff. Also online event production isn‚Äôt free or even always cheap. They are likely still paying a ton to make it as cool as possible online.  I love your ideas, just trying to chip in from the POV of an employee (and part time grad student) on what the administration might be thinking. There is probably not just a bunch of money sitting around.
comment,COVID-19,positive,This is a great idea! I‚Äôm graduating this semester too and it feels like we‚Äôre just being sent into the void with absolutely no assistance or resources. It sucks.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Yeah, we didn't get anything, so I wouldn't hold your breath. Although fwiw I can still use the Adobe software I downloaded in my last semester.
comment,COVID-19,negative,Do you have any idea how expensive lifetime access, or even a few years of access, to those programs is? It's far beyond what it costs to host a graduation ceremony.   I don't have an issue with free access to the alumni association; I think everyone should get that automatically. Football tickets is eh.  And your last paragraph ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been so busy with school... all these resources‚Äù is more of your own prioritization problem than the university‚Äôs issue or fault.
comment,COVID-19,positive,It is my understanding that they hope to offer a separate in-person graduations for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 when it is safe to do so.  No, it's not ideal (or practical) for every graduate or their family to return to Ann Arbor for it, but there is demand, and some will.  It is not the ideal situation--but as far as i know that's the option that is being considered.  In that case, the money for graduation is being "banked" and held to cover the expenses that will require.    Since the money for graudation is essentially a line-item budget for the University, it's not true that there is *literally no reason* the University can't use the money for alumni benefits for the Class of 2021.  It's something the Regents would have to agree to.  Doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile thing to propose--but you should take this up with Regents.
comment,COVID-19,positive,6 months after graduation, I'm surprised I even still have access to my email account.
post,Sports,positive,Hi y'all, I used to love going to Michigan hockey games as a kid and kinda wanted to buy the season tickets this year,,, but I also don't wanna go alone.  Is it worth it?
comment,Sports,positive,Michigan Hockey games are super fun. And the student section is even better.   I had tickets for a season when I had a roommate who also bought them, and we went together. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with going alone (the student section is friendly and you wouldn‚Äôt feel alone once you were there) but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt make the trek all the way down to Yost if I wasn‚Äôt committed to going with someone else. (I lived on the Hill and my classes were about 50/50 on North Campus by then.)   Like basketball, there are a lot of weeknight games and weeks with multiple games in one week. Which can make it kind of hard to attend them all.   I‚Äôm not sure how active it is anymore, but Children of Yost used to have a strong Facebook group. Maybe they‚Äôve moved onto another network that‚Äôs more popular with current students?
comment,Sports,positive,Check your messages friend
comment,Sports,neutral,I really want to buy hockey season tickets and I am a student. When and how can I buy them?
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Hi guys. So this is mostly in two regards:  1. Intellectually. Did you guys start feeling the urge to learn things on your own, for fun, again, if you lost it during undergrad? How long did it take for that to come back?  2. Financially/employment-wise. Did you guys have jobs lined up right away, move back in with your parents, stay at a dingy apartment in A2 for a while?  If you have any other post-grad experience and wisdom you'd like to share I'd love to hear that too.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. Yes.  The problem is the quality of information is not as consistent outside of academia.  You will have to do some legwork to ensure that you are consuming high quality information. 2. I had a job lined up that began a few months after graduation.  I lived with my parents until then.  This isn't the case with everyone.  I was lucky.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. I think I tried to hold onto it for a bit after graduation. I read a lot, tried to attend guest lectures and talks whenever I could, but then once I got a decent job and settled into a routine, I felt relatively content with where I was, intellectually-speaking. I spent most of my late 20s feeling this way, and I think it's a place a lot of people end up. In the past few years, I've felt that thirst for knowledge and learning again. It's forced me to start newer projects at work, to look into new career opportunities, and to try to find new hobbies that scratch the creative itch.  1. I had an internship in my field lined up right after graduation, but it was only temporary and the pay wasn't great. I moved back to Ann Arbor after the internship and started bartending as something to hold me over until I found something more in-line with my career goals. I did it for a little over a year before finding a full-time position at the University, and have been working different positions at the U ever since. I do regret staying in Ann Arbor. In hindsight I wish I had picked up and explored somewhere entirely new. Graduating from college is the perfect time to pick up and set roots in a new location. Once you settle into a new place, it's hard to leave.  I have two main pieces of advice for post-graduation.  The first is to take some time to thoroughly enjoy not being in school. I think a lot of fresh-out-of-college grads are so eager to please and prove themselves when they enter the workforce that they end up selling themselves to their jobs. Don't be afraid to set boundaries to prevent your work from creeping into your personal life.  The second is to embrace humility and reject pride. Just because you have a college degree, that doesn't make you "above" any sort of job or lifestyle or whatever.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I am an old person, so perhaps you will dismiss this as not working for your generation, but here goes.  Job/Career:  When I graduated (not from UM FWIW) I first took a temp summer job.  I was having kittens over the fact that I, a honors graduate, had no REAL JOB after four years of expensive tuition.  But I had a number of older people (including, thankfully, my parents) regularly telling me to not freak out.  That I didn't have to have it all figured out yet.  At the end of that summer I found a fun but low-paying job (in my case, working in college admissions) and did that for a few years.  I lived in a crappy cheap apartment. Had a great social life with other broke young adults. I learned a ton, it was a safe environment working with a lot of people at a similar life stage, to develop myself and think about careers and life goals.  Figuring out what I liked and didn't like in that job.  Then I went to grad school with more direction and focus and have had a career since.  A lot of my friends did something similar.  Most of my classmates kicked around for awhile, then buckled down and moved into more of a career track.  Few of us stepped right into some highpowered job or management training program and started heading up some defined career ladder.  Of course in some majors that's the way it's done--none of us had that kind of major.  Now we are all old and the jobs/careers we are in are diverse, interesting, meaningful, rewarding.  No one failed because their first job sucked or didn't pay a lot.  Intellectually:  I was burned out for awhile, which made it a good thing I started out with a job that was fairly chill.  Second year on the job I got a roommate who was a former English major and when she moved all her books in (tons of stuff I'd heard of but never read) it was like a switch was flipped and I started reading again.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. No not really unless it's part of a hobby or my job (I read a lot of fiction for fun but I don't count that as learning per say). I don't usually feel like just learning something for the sake of learning. School, all throughout life, is designed to erode your intrinsic desire to learn so don't feel bad if you don't feel like learning for fun after you graduate. 2. I didn't graduate from here for undergrad (did my PhD here), but I tried applying to grad school right out of the gate, didn't get in, then worked for two years, and applied again and ended up coming here. If you're thinking about grad school DEFINITELY work first before applying. As far as lining up a job I would do your best to have something lined up when you graduate so you can start having some financial independence. I wouldn't stress about getting a job in your exact field of interest. People's paths are rarely so linear that they go right from getting a degree to getting a job in their chosen field. Who knows maybe you'll find that you actually like working in a different field.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. Yes, to include reading for fun. It took maybe 6 months? I still don't read anything super literary, though.  2. I went right to grad school. After that, I  worked as a freelancer in my field and part time doing random other stuff for financial stability. I could have moved in with my parents and saved money, but that would have been hard on me personally. But that wasn't in the middle of the pandemic, so finding work was actually possible. I stayed in A2 over the summer after graduating--highly recommend.  3. If I could do it again, I might wait a couple of years before heading to grad school. I was pretty burned out on the whole school thing, and I think I would have appreciated it more with some time off first. Try to keep your friendships and mentorships from school going, especially at the moment because it's very hard to make new friends. Also, remember that your skillset for a job isn't necessarily exactly what your major was about--it's the thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills you learned at U of M. And enjoy not having homework. Congrats!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. Yes. Never stop learning, either for personal growth (life experiences, hobbies, etc) or professional growth (new technologies/techniques, conferences, field knowledge). The key for me is to tie this back to experiences and goals. For example, I work in IT, so learning new technologies and using them is highly valued for me personally (I‚Äôm interested in this) and work (keeps me relevant, they pay me more). I also mountain bike a lot, so learning bike maintenance, trail stewardship, and how to socialize with a diverse age group is important (beer helps). 2. I‚Äôm not a good example here. I was working full time while going to school on the side, so technically ‚Äúyes, I had a job lined up‚Äù. The college diploma did help me get a new job shortly after. Since I‚Äôm in IT, my diploma didn‚Äôt really help in my field, it only certified the notion that I can think and learn.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,My post graduate (CoE class of 2018) experience went like this:  Graduate. Start a new job across the country 2 weeks later. Start learning the skills for a new job, relevant regulatory bodies rules, company processes, etc. start to settle in to new place.  Find out company is shutting down the division about 6 weeks after I started. They give us 2 months heads up. Scramble to find job. Abandon that part of my industry and go towards another side of it. Find a new job, move across the country again.   Start to settle in to new/current job. Company values education, so work through a lot of company and industry training as part of on boarding. Get assigned to a major project after completing training/required education.  Settle into project over a year or so, establish routine, still learning but it‚Äôs all pretty comfortable. Start to explore education opportunities. Tried UM Coursera courses that are free to alumni, wanted to learn Python as my company values analytics skills and whatnot. Never really went anywhere with it or finished the courses because self paced was hard to find motivation for. That‚Äôs just me though. Gave up after about 6 months of on and off trying it.  Enrolled in an online graduate certificate program last fall with another school, credits apply towards an MBA if I choose to pursue it later. Company pays for it all, and it‚Äôs actual graduate level classes so I keep more focused on it.   Personally, I always fall back to education when work isn‚Äôt challenging me. Frankly my job is easy and I have a lot of spare time, so I try to use my time to build education. I look at other jobs that would keep me more engaged at times, but it‚Äôs hard to give up a good, well paying, secure job in a location I like.  Learning on my own in less formal environments shifted though. More reading for pleasure, more learning about hobbies, realizing personal finance is something I should be working on actively. Learning to cook is a great skill to invest time in. You‚Äôve gotta eat, so might as well make it better.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Graduated last spring so not much experience yet and I know how lucky I've been  1. I find that learning is much easier when you actually want to learn (vs being forced to learn). I always had a few side projects and hobbies that I was working on so I keep learning new things to make progress on the things that I want to work on. It's just slightly harder to figure out what guides to blindly follow because you don't always have an "expert" telling you what you need to do. I definitely started looking into second bachelors/masters and taking random classes right after graduating but that went away by the time fall semester rolled around. I was always bad at learning through things like coursera and found that just jumping in and learning whatever I need along the way is the fastest and easiest way for me to learn things. My job happens to be exactly what I want to do and I have to constantly learn new things on the spot so I don't mind learning in that context. 2. Getting a master's degree here was my backup plan to not finding a full time job before graduating from here for undergrad. I knew exactly what I wanted to do and umich had a professional master's degree that was very closely related and I didn't find a job in that field before I graduated from undergrad so the easy solution for me was to just take a vacation and then go directly to that master's program (only applied to umich). I've lived in Ann Arbor since I was 5 so I never really got to leave Ann Arbor except for actual vacations and am glad that my parents at least let me live on my own for undergrad (they forced me to stay with them for grad school since they were paying). I graduated from grad school last spring and was extremely lucky to have a job that didn't really get affected by the pandemic (didn't get any of the jobs that I was interviewing for before the pandemic) so I basically just went from internship summer of 2019 to part time for the last year of my master's program to full time after graduating and didn't bother moving out of my parents house yet. This arrangement basically lets me save/invest a lot more.  Depending on your relationship with your parents/siblings, it can be worth just living with them until you save enough money to live on your own. You don't have to work in whatever you get your degrees in and a lot of skills and knowledge transfer directly to other fields (I found it really hard to convince myself of that when I was looking for jobs).
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,2020 grad here.  1. Sort of. It takes a while to settle because your first several months on the job is very much a continued state of being on fire. You're doing a lot of learning new tools, processes, and cultural norms while also in a constant anxiety spiral. It gets better! But until it does, you don't really have much energy to actively learn anything not directly related to your field. I'm now seven month in, and I'm feeling settled enough to start learning again. 2. Jobs took a minute, what with the global pandemic and all that. I moved back in with my parents in the meantime, and I'm still there. There's an obvious benefit to being at home: I'm not paying rent, and therefore I'm rolling in it. If it's possible and your family situation is solid, it's a really good option. I really recommend considering it.  I see you still have a year, and you're probably just now getting into the job hunt. I don't know your major, but I was LSA, and the hunt was fucking brutal. The career center was... unhelpful, to put it politely (ETA cuz I'm dumb and hit post wayy too early), but YMMV. I got my gig through a family friend, which is a source of great personal shame, but it seemed like the only way it was gonna happen with everything hitting the fan. Things might look better when you graduate. They might not. But do what you have to do to take care of yourself, even if it stings your pride.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I graduated last May.  1) If I'm learning something for fun/on my own time, it most likely has to do with my hobbies (like music theory or getting better at a video game for example). Occasionally I'll read software development articles and stuff if I find it interesting.  2) I didn't have a job lined up after graduating. It took me a couple of months to find employment. I was lucky that my parents supported me during this time.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. 100%. i took a break for a while to just enjoy having time after work to do hobbies and chill, and honestly even just to sleep. lmao. but i pretty much started reading again for fun and training in different dance styles right away, and then started seriously learning korean (having tutors, doing hw, etc) all for fun after about a year after graduating. i would say don't underestimate how much location, meeting new people, and being on your own can really inspire you to learn new things and new hobbies. i feel like i found an even greater passion for the things i enjoy and want to explore post-grad than i ever would have expected!  2. i was really blessed, but i pretty much had a job lined up right away. i was in some final stage recruiting by the time i was leaving ann arbor. i graduated and moved back home in may immediately after the ceremonies, had a job and signed my contract by around memorial day weekend, and then moved to my new city and started a job mid-july.   i would say that if you can and have the financial means to do so, 100% take a break (i'm talking at least 1-2 months) to chill and rejuvenate before starting a job. after graduating, i kid you not slept for at least 12 hours a day + took 1 hour naps for at least two weeks. you may find that you're more tired than you think after leaving school lol.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,So, I went into grad school online through another university the fall right after graduation (graduating this May!). So, I had a bit of a break and then it was back to work so to speak. Though, I do still love going down wikipedia rabbit holes from time to time and learning things.   If it's relevant, to be honest, going through school for as long as I have without much of a break is leaving me pretty burnt out. I've only got a few more months and I love my program so I can't really complain.  Employment wise I am so lucky to have been able to keep my part-time job on campus in the field that I'm in grad school for, which I'd had for a few months before I graduated from here. Working on figuring out the next big move rn though now that I'm about to have a Masters Degree under my belt.   My wisdom, especially during pandemic time: Try to do what you love. Being absolutely psyched to go into work and to learn things in my grad school classes has been a major drive for me when there's not much else to do. ;)
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1) Shortly after graduation I tried a bunch of different hobbies and found some that stuck and that I really enjoy still. I sometimes get the itch to work hard and start some project or something. I'm pursuing a professional license in my field that takes about 4-5 years to get.         2)Had a job lined up after graduation in my home state. Moved back in with parents to save boatloads of $$$ on expensive rent. Most people in my major had jobs lined up or some sort of masters degrees planned following graduation. I'm sure its different now with covid screwing up internships and job offers.         Overall I don't work even close to as hard as I did in college. Also have a lot more free time. A few times a year I have a stressful day or week, or even month, but nothing like the pressure of going through UM.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. This one is gonna depend person to person, but yes I've been very motivated to learn stuff in my off time for the most part.  2. I didn't have a job lined up. I graduated in May of last year, and eventually got an amazing opportunity in January of this year to work for Toyota as an aero engineer. My advice is to find recruiters at companies like Kyyba, Aerotek, etc. They will find you better opportunities than you can using only online applications. 100% I would be still unemployed and probably be broke if not for Kyyba finding the job posting and helping me get an interview.  Another bit of advice I have is to go easy on yourself, especially in this day and age. I best myself up lot about taking so long to find a job, and I still beat myself up over small mistakes at work and in life. Try to just chill, ask questions at work and in life, and it'll all be okay.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,1. This never went away, although I ended up doing medical school later on and physicians are expected to continue to be lifelong learners (with mandatory educational activities as stipulated by our specialty board) so that would explain it. 2. I ended up moving back in my parents, and while I did not have a job lined up (and med school was still several years away at that point), when I finally did get a job I still lived at home due to combination of a not-so-great salary and free rent. I did not finally move out of my parents' house again until nearly halfway into my second year of med school.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Lmao nononono. I had none, frankly. I signed up for zip recruiter and blasted my resume out to every employer.   Ah yes, academia. Where they give you theory but they never tell you how to actually look for a job, interview and how to be an employee for an employer üëÄüòù
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I'm in this boat myself actually and here's my experience so far: 1. I picked reading back up about 1.5 months after graduating (it was my biggest hobby before college where I'd read 1000 page books every other week for fun). This is mostly due to no job yet though, since there's not much to do here in pandemic land. I have started learning editing softwares for film as a fun side project as well but that's due to a push from my friends who want to make a movie of sorts. The "learning for fun" isn't exactly back yet but it's slowly coming. 2. I had nothing lined up after graduation so I moved back in with my parents onto their pullout sofa. Then I decided I couldn't stand that and instead decided to crash at a friends apartment on their air mattress since it beats living with my family. I actually have been using the stimulus money and some savings I had saved for relocation expenses to keep myself afloat while job hunting but I have a feeling I'll need to be getting a part time job soon here to keep the savings safe/keep staying afloat.  What I've gotten out of this so far is that you kinda just have to be patient while also making sure you're getting the apps in. If you don't have a job lined up yet, this time works really well for recuperation after college to get back into old hobbies and reclaim the parts of you that you set aside for college.
post,Food / Culture,positive,So I'm going to be attending next year and I know a lot of people who go to Wayne and MSU. They always mention how "supportive" and not as toxic their schools are. Is it true Michigan is to some degree more "competitive" or "toxic" than these other state schools. And if so how much of an impact does this make. I don't want to get drawn into an environment where people aren't helping each other.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,It‚Äôs funny cause people who always say that type of stuff about uofm never actually go here and are probably trying to make the school look worse.   I obviously can‚Äôt comment on everyone‚Äôs experience here but I‚Äôd say most students aren‚Äôt toxic at all. People are always forming study groups, making big class groupmes, and generally helping each other out. I‚Äôm sure there are cases where groups of friends are competitive, but you‚Äôll see that anywhere. I would say there‚Äôs an implicit competitive feeling just cause we‚Äôre at a pretty prestigious school, but you‚Äôll rarely see people being toxic about it.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,There's a lot of toxicity at U-M on game day against Ohio State, but you'll be okay if you're not wearing red!  Seriously though, I don't think "competitiveness" at U-M refers to anyone academically trying to sandbag their peers. It's more competitive in terms of admission criteria, but I don't think you'd find any difference in friendliness within the school. It's a big school, and some intro courses are huge, so sometimes people feel lost in a way they wouldn't at a small school with small classes.  Maybe there is some toxic behavior in isolated cases, competing for a single scholarship in a department or something, but I never saw any deliberate unhelpfulness or sabotage as an engineering undergrad. I think that's more of a Hollywood trope than common occurrence in reality.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,No, just this subreddit.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,I found Michigan to me much more collaborative than competitive, if that‚Äôs what you mean.   I also ran into people who didn‚Äôt go to UM (some who didn‚Äôt get in and were bitter about it, but not saying that‚Äôs the only motivator) who would loudly say they‚Äôre glad they didn‚Äôt go to UM because the people are so competitive, the social environment is lacking, the people are ugly, etc. They never attended UM so they really didn‚Äôt know. And most of them had an axe to grind.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I don't think Michigan is toxic. It's definitely more rigorous academically, which may make some students more stressed out or feel like there's competition, but I don't think that vibe is actually present (at least in the undergraduate liberal arts, where I am. I can't speak to business or engineering).   It sounds to me like your friends just know that Michigan is a more academic, selective school and have inadvertently equated that to competition and toxicity.   Michigan is less toxic than I felt like my high school was, and it was a fairly typical public school.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Nah Michigan is known to be one of the more supportive schools out there. I've never seen a person unwilling to help and everyone always has each others' back. It is a huge contrast to the snaky public across the US. Trust me the vibe is def very supportive and not cutthroat competition
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I‚Äôm a freshmen and I have never felt unsupported. I have had no problems finding awesome study groups for my difficult classes even with no in person classes (shoutout to my FABULOUS math 215 study group). In my CS classes there‚Äôs definitely some know it all assholes, but the vast majority are super kind (there‚Äôs even a no judgement groupme for one of my CS classes for those of us that aren‚Äôt very confident). I don‚Äôt think Michigan will be much more toxic than any other school, people just complain about it more here because I think classwork is a bigger part of our everyday life here than other schools.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I've had the off encounter with some students and professors, as you would anywhere, but for the most part everyone is super nice and understanding.  I come from a particularly challenging background, no money, tons of mental health issues, etc, but I've hardly ever felt un-supported or looked down upon.  Now, that being said I did / still do have the issue of comparing myself to students that are better off than me. I can really see the financial difference in terms of what we worry about, wear, how we treat our grades now, etc, and I put a lot of pressure on myself to seem "normal" in that regard, but no one has ever looked at me differently for it except me, I think.  Another bit about support--CAPS isn't always the best but I think it's leagues better than most other university's mental health options.  And in terms of friends and academics--I can get pretty bad at half-assing my readings, assignments, etc., and I can tell it irritates some of my peers that I don't care enough / am still passing or doing well without the work effort they put in, but it's usually like a moment of frustration, probably mostly directed at themselves, more than it's anything toxic or unfriendly. I went to a pretty crappy public school and the people here are farrrrr nicer and more supportive, especially when I compare my university friends to the friends I had from high school that went to other universities. I'm in the liberal arts school though, where you at least have to take one class that includes studying different identities and how that affects us all. Maybe that has something to do with it :)
comment,Food / Culture,positive,TLDR: No. but stuck up yes  I've never heard Michigan described as "Toxic," more of as "Stuck up."  I see what everyone else is posting here about collaboration and study groups and I think that's a perfect explanation of how conducive to learning and success the atmosphere is. The city always has events going on to make you feel at home, and honestly a beautiful time. A GREAT place to go to university.  However, the stuck up-ness comes out when dealing with other universities. When I was touring UofM and MSU, I spent one whole day at MSU (three including travel days) and four whole days at UofM (six including travel days). MSU framed their tour as, "hey welcome! You might not be choosing us but we think that's ok! Here are our programs, we just want you to have a great fit." UofM framed their tour as, "hey you got accepted, great! When you get accepted, you're going here for sure." There was a sense that UofM was the end-all and only way, even though there were juniors in my tour group.   Now that was just tour/admissions, prone to be one sided. But as I talk to my friends (older and younger) who went there, and compare them to my friends who went to MSU and Grand Valley, the UofM cohort have a sense that they're better people. Not just education or experiences, but better people. Ive talked to MSU alumns and this comes out when in the "real working world" when they encounter someone from UofM who just has a stuck up air about them, makes snide comments, and again has that sense of just being a better person.  Now I'm not saying MSU or GV alumns are better. Some MSU students/grads are dumb as bricks. But the programs at those schools are on par. So no, I find UofM to not be toxic, my sister loved it and only really commented on the rigorous coursework. But stuck up? Yes.  Edit: oh my God I wrote a lot sorry
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I think it could depend on your major/department, but in my experience it has been the opposite. I didn‚Äôt go to undergrad at Umich, and I generally found my major at another institution to be more competitive than my current field in graduate school at Umich. I was pleasantly surprised how supportive and collaborative people at Umich have been. My grad program is pretty big, but so many people reached out when my dad died, and I see everyone trying to support each other even virtually. I think Michigan definitely can put more academic work on students and we can be more stressed, but maybe that‚Äôs also why more people try to collaborate.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,I think Michigan students are fine with helping each other and don't sabotage other students, if that's what you mean. It's competitive in the sense that classes are difficult and everyone is high achieving, but **not** in the sense that people are working against each other.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I'll be honest and say the majority is not toxic but CS is competitive to the point where it is toxic in the weeder classes like 203, 280, and 281. I am a EE major and I'm I've taken all three of those mentioned classes and my EE classes have students that are way more helpful and collaborative when it comes to exam prep and general help. In my CS classes, I noticed the competitive nature of "beating the curve" for good grades in these weeder classes to be a bit toxic. With that combined with the hunt for CS internships, it really becomes kinda toxic unfortunately. There are so many CS students and not enough help in office hours or opportunities to talk to recruiters at career fairs that it does become toxic. The rest of Michigan is amazing though. I love all my EE classes and the students are so helpful and really makes the experience enjoyable.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,I don‚Äôt think so. There‚Äôs other issues here but I wouldn‚Äôt say toxicity is one of them.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I think this is one of those things where it really depends what you make of it. To be quite honest, if you want to find toxic people, then there's no shortage of them here to add a dampener to your college experience. After all, this is a pretty competitive school and high competition can sometimes promote narcissism/off-color behavior within some people.  However, there are *even more* cool, intelligent, insightful, fun, and awesome people to be around, you just gotta be proactive about finding the people you click with and the people who are gonna be a positive influence on your academic and personal life. There's a great sense of community and camaraderie here so overall it's a great environment to have your college experience at.  Welcome to Michigan!
comment,Food / Culture,positive,Overall, bot really. More specifically, what it really comes down to is what type of people you make friends with. You make friends with the right type of people, and you'll never experience any toxicity at all.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,nah it‚Äôs not toxic. be careful of Ross kids tho
comment,Food / Culture,positive,When I think of toxic I think of stories where people remove pages from reserve readings so that their classmates can't access them.  Deliberately sabotaging lab experiments.  That kind of thing.  I haven't heard those stories here (although maybe they happen).    I think some students are competitive and flex a lot.  Some departments/majors have a reputation of having more of these.  That doesn't mean you have to join in.  Some people like the competitive push, others don't.  It's good to read the replies from students who have good things to say about the environment they've found here.  Never forget, the climate is set, at least partially, by the people in it--and on a college campus there is the opportunity for change and renewal because each year some students graduate and new ones enroll.  When you get here, you are part of it.  How you are, and the things you value, can contribute to the climate and can change it for the better.  Don't underestimate your ability to shape this place (or any campus you may end up at) into a better environment, however you find it!
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I think it depends on context / who you are. As a dude who studied CS, I found that it was pretty collaborative, and even though it was competitive people were still friendly. Some of my non-men friends definitely experienced toxicity in the program, though.   Similarly, lots of students at the school are pretty wealthy and ime this led to a general lack of empathy towards poor people. This might not be the toxicity you're describing, but I think it's certainly a form of "toxicity"
comment,Food / Culture,positive,As someone who went to undergrad at MSU and now grad school at UM, I can say, from my experience, that the atmosphere is very different. The student body at MSU felt more "down to earth" than UM does. It was also much easier to talk with professors than it is here. I'm not sure if I would use the word toxic, but there is definitely an air of pompousness and entitlement, and I think that has to do with how the university markets itself. Since they peddle in prestige, they attract a lot of "big head" and affluent students.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,No go outside more
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I find it interesting that many of these comments disagree with the notion of Michigan being toxic or competitive... I think maybe it depends on background and preference but I definitely found that to be at least slightly true but usually I‚Äôd say hell yeah this place is toxic but the other comments make me wonder if I‚Äôm the only one who has had a poor experience. I‚Äôd say that if you tend to compare yourself to others maybe you can internalize an otherwise okay environment to be toxic. Idk... also level of support has varied across years and professors - some more understanding than others. Overall I haven‚Äôt had a great time here but who is to say I would have been better elsewhere
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,Seems a lot of things that are difficult/competitive or are challenging to one's world view are "toxic" these days.
post,Class,negative,I put in a lot of work for this class only for them to tear me apart on their grading of the lab reports. I saw on atlas that most people get A's how in the hell is this possible? Is there a large curve at the end?
comment,Class,positive,Was GSI for 211 last semester.  The lead instructor manually went through ALL the final grades from all the sections and made sure the average was a B+/A- by curving things up. Some people, by the standards of my alma mater SHOULD have received at best a C.  It is a goal of the chem lab directors to ensure that the class averages are B+/A-.
comment,Class,neutral,I think it depends on your GSI, I‚Äôd recommend going to office hours, whenever I was stuck I went there to clarify.  Edit:  also I believe there was a small to decent size curve (I had it last semester).
comment,Class,positive,Aren't the lab reports just docs you answer questions about? It is one of those classes that you just have to set aside your night for and get as much done as you can. Make notes about the things you don't understand, and then go to a gsi office hours (or two of them) and just work out all of the problems that you previously identified. Most gsi's will be happy to really help you understand, and sometimes they'll outright give you the answer. If you chill in office hours you can also compare what you got with other people, which also helps. It is absolutely possible to get an A.
post,COVID-19,negative,I recently got my weekly covid test done for the first time. Before I got my test done, ResponsiBLUE said that I needed to get tested and there was a red X but as soon as I got tested, that box immediately disappeared on the app. Has this happened to anyone else before?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,The test automatically gets updated on the App. Once you have your results you should be seeing a green checkmark saying "Completed" on there.
comment,COVID-19,negative,The box disappeared?? That‚Äôs odd I didn‚Äôt know it did that.   About 2 hours after your test it should be green with the check.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I noticed that I was also missing the testing box, it may be because I opted out of testing as I am not on campus. Did you happen to do the same, especially given that you are only now getting your first test?
comment,COVID-19,neutral,side question, is the covid test they do the one where they shove the thing up your nose? The last time I did one of those my nose started bleeding and kept at it for a while.
post,Class,positive,So I'm pretty sure I just secured a failing grade for one of my classes already, regardless of how well I do for the rest of the semester. Seeing as this is only my second college semester, it's kind of stressing me out. I was wondering how a failed class has affected other people and what impact it has had on their path through college. This was a four-credit class that was core for my intended major, but obviously, I'm going to switch majors now lol.
comment,Class,positive,Hi, my best advice is to first check with your professor/do the math to make sure there is no way for you to pass and if you cant pass withdraw from that class and retake it next semester. I've had to retake at least two of my four credit major classes and I am thriving in my major now. It did add on another semester for me, but I also only took 12-14 credits each seamster since thats all I could handle. Failing a class isnt a reason to not major in something. Best of luck to you :)
comment,Class,positive,Sounds like Bio 172
comment,Class,positive,Hi love! My first semester at UMich I  was on the verge of failing the prereq for what I intended to major in. I took a bunch of 200 level courses right off the bat and it only started to hit me late in the semester that it was all more than I could handle. Most nights I was staying up until 4am and getting up at 7 for class at 8. I ended up so burnt out even my self-absorbed family started to worry.  I ended up withdrawing from that class and just choosing random classes the next semester that I thought sounded really fun and interesting (that could also count for distribution requirements if I didn't choose to major in them). Turns out, I loved two of them and decided to double major in entirely different departments. I liked the professors a lot better as well as the students and the assignments, though I enjoyed the subjects relatively the same, if even a bit more. My grades also ended up being a lot better in my new majors.  So my advice: it doesn't hurt to try something new, especially if you need a break. It also doesn't hurt to try again if you really think your major was the right path for you - - difficult doesn't translate to wrong! My minor is particularly hard on me but I think it's also worth it :)
comment,Class,positive,I definitely agree with the other answers, you're almost certain to do better the second time around after having been exposed to so much of the material. However, there's no shame in changing majors too because one thing I see a lot of when people change majors it seems like they realize that the thing they thought they'd enjoy and find interesting wasn't as good a time as they thought after getting deeper in, and if this is one of your core classes that reflects what this career field entails, that could be the case. If your heart is set on this major then do what you need to do in order to buckle down and succeed, but if could be a time to be real with yourself about what kind of path you see for yourself. Best of luck.
comment,Class,positive,I had that class winter 2020 (my freshman year as well), barely passed and halfway through I thought I was going to fail for sure.  Like mentioned above, make sure to see if there is a viable route to passing.  And if there isn‚Äôt, make sure you talk with your advisor about freshman forgiveness (I don‚Äôt know how it works with Covid, but definitely meet with an advisor).    Nonetheless, good luck!!  Edit:  this was intended to be a comment under the eecs 280, idk how it became a post.
comment,Class,neutral,It's okay I actually failed a four-credit class that was core for my intended major in my second semester of college and I passed it last semester and I'm now declared! If you don't want to sit through it again then I don't blame you but if you choose to do it again you can definitely make it through. I stuck it out the first time and got a NRC, so it didn't affect my GPA at all (though I was definitely sad about it). Also, for EECS 280 there's the minimum competency so you might have a chance. Definitely check with the professors. If you do withdraw, they actually have to review your request (my advisor told me it's just a formality) so it's not bad to give them a heads-up.
post,New Student,positive,Hey, I'm brand new here, having just transferred from a community college.  For mainly some personal issues, I've really been underperforming on one class, and despite my high GPA and current A standing in other courses, I *know* I won't do well in this class, and maybe won't be able to pass it at all. For that reason, I applied to withdraw from the course. I'd think that my pretty clean record would help getting a W, but I'm nervous.  Is there anything I should know about the withdrawal process? Is there a risk of my application being rejected? I can't afford continuing this class, and I'd much rather just take the financial loss. It'd be the end of me if I had to stay in this class. I've been so torn up these past couple days.  Thank you for any help, it means so much.  EDIT: For those commenting, is there any risk of my application being rejected? While I‚Äôm not excited about a W, it‚Äôd be so much better than an F haha
comment,New Student,positive,As an employer and former engineering student, no one cares about a W.
comment,New Student,negative,W‚Äôs are basically guaranteed, especially in COVID time. The ‚Äúapplication process‚Äù is mostly there just to stop students from fleeing courses in which they‚Äôve been caught cheating, or similar edge cases.
comment,New Student,negative,I don't know why nobody is mentioning this but if you drop a class this semester, a W will not show up on your official transcript.   https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/covid-19-fall20-winter21-grading
comment,New Student,positive,Been in your situation before. Please don't worry about it. People won't mind one 'W' in your college career if you consistently perform well. Life happens. What might be worrying is if you have a pattern of 'W's. Employers and grad school admission officers understand. I've done two 'W's before and I still got admitted into UMich's grad program + internships at awesome places. What matters more is your mental health! Also, don't let one class bring down your grades in your other classes!
comment,New Student,positive,This would be fine at ANY time.  It's especially find during the pandemic!    Many students are going to have variances in their transcripts this year: fewer credits attempted or earned, more grades masked, More courses taken P/F etc.  I don't know how much scrutiny anyone can give this year in contact of your overall academic record.  Don't sweat it.
comment,New Student,negative,I got into grad school with a few Ws  W are better then an F People acquire Ws for a range of reasons (like if you change major mid semester and can drop difficult classes of their old major for example)  I wouldn‚Äôt stress to much about it.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I got a 5 on Calc BC last year and took Calc 3 at community college last sem.   On the AP guidelines it says I get 8 credits total if I get C or better for MATH 215. Would this still apply if I got C or better on Calc 3 (UM equivalent of MATH 215) and transferred that or is it only for when the course is taken at Umich?   Edit: For LSA btw
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,You have to take MATH 215 for a grade at UM to qualify under that policy.   When you transfer a class in from another college or university, the grade does not transfer. It comes in as a ‚ÄúT‚Äù for transfer.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Your situation sounds like you should have credit for calc 1-3 once you transfer? If you had a 5 on BC, pretty sure it should still count for 115/116.
post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Do you guys think 6 weeks is enough for both of these classes in the summer? Is the pace manageable?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Depends on if ur good at math, I imagine they aren't at the same time right?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Quick question, but where are you finding these six week courses?  The only ones I‚Äôm finding on the course guide are at least 10 weeks long.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I actually did this at Oakland community college and it was fine
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,6 weeks for calc one and then 6 weeks for calc two, or 6 weeks for both together?

post,Satellite Campus,negative,Hi I was just accepted into uofm flint on Hail scholarship. Flint is notorious for terrible water though. Is the water at the university ok or anywhere in town for that matter? Would I be better off at a local town or is the water bad in the surrounding areas aswell? Sorry if it‚Äôs a dumb question.
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,the pipes actually still havent been replaced, contrary to the other comment, but the water in all campus buildings, including residence halls, is tested to ensure safe drinking. i will say though, if youre not staying in a residence hall, i would not recommend staying in a flint city apartment if you‚Äôve never been here before. things go from ‚Äúhey this isnt a bad area, not sure what the fuss is about‚Äù to ‚Äúholy shit i need to leave‚Äù pretty quickly, and its impossible to know what areas to avoid without having been or lived here before. if youre looking at getting an apartment not sponsored by the university, maybe look for housing in Davison, Burton, Clio, Swartz Creek, Flushing, or Fenton (neighboring cities) for an apartment. They‚Äôre still affordable, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about not feeling safe, especially if you‚Äôre a woman.    source: i have lived on the outskirts of the city of Flint my whole life, more than willing to answer any questions you have, just PM me
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,I‚Äôm pretty sure the offending pipes from the water crisis have since been replaced, but this subreddit is dedicated to the Ann Arbor campus so we might not be a good resource for anything flint related.
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,Question for you...were you offered the hail scholarship and chose to not apply to Ann Arbor or did not get into Ann Arbor and are assuming you can use the hail scholarship at flint?  Just wondering because my son was notified in the fall that he would get the hail scholarship if he applied and got in. He applied and his decision is currently postponed. He got in to Dearborn but they‚Äôve not mentioned the hail scholarship. He will likely go to AA if he gets in but have tried reaching out to people at AA and Dearborn to confirm the scholarship can be used at Dearborn also and was told by AA ‚Äúhe may be able to use it at Dearborn‚Äù uh what? And Dearborn said AA is in charge of the scholarship and to ask them ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Just want a clear answer so when it comes time to make a decision we‚Äôll know he‚Äôs getting the $
post,New Student,positive,As a community college transfer student, I am wondering about UROP. What was your guys‚Äô experience like when participating in UROP? I am interested in research and look forward to many interesting UROP stories from you all.
comment,New Student,positive,I‚Äôm currently in UROP and it has been a good opportunity for me (I think I‚Äôm going to continue with my project over the summer!). Lot of people will tell you to blind email profs but I found that very intimidating and a lot of them either don‚Äôt respond or take forever, while with UROP I got accepted to like 5 project and got to choose my favorite (some people aren‚Äôt this lucky in UROP, but it mainly depends on your interview skills and how prompt you are at sending out your resumes). There is a lot of busy work associated with the class portion, but I think the symposium that is put on at the end of the semester is a great, fairly unique/rare opportunity for us younger students to get a chance to share our work.   If you are a transfer student, I believe you will be doing changing gears, which is essential the same thing but for older transfer students since traditional UROP is strongly focused on freshmen (although there are some sophomores)  Overall, if you can get a paid position on your own, that‚Äôs probably better, but if you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt really know where to start, UROP is great.
comment,New Student,positive,Hi! I know there is a UROP section called changing gears that is specifically for transfer students. I did not do this program, but I did regular UROP. I thought it taught me some nice skills like how to present at a symposium and how to write cover letters. The overall seminars were a little tedious at times and some of the work was busy work, but I loved my research and I am still working on the same team I joined through UROP. Another plus is that you can get credit or work study and I feel like it‚Äôs a pretty easy A. I am a peer facilitator for UROP now and the grades are based on how many points you get, so if you miss an assignment, you can just make up the points by doing a different assignment and you won‚Äôt be penalized. Overall I think it‚Äôs really good for getting your foot in the door with research. And you can have structured guidance if you have any questions about the research process
comment,New Student,positive,I‚Äôm a transfer student and I‚Äôm currently in UROP. Like the others said you will apply to UROP through the changing gears which is for only for transfer students. For me personally it was hard to find a project in the beginning. I didn‚Äôt find a project until November. I didn‚Äôt have good interview skills so I was one of the unlucky ones. I believe I applied to 6-7 projects I only got a response to one which is the one I‚Äôm currently in. Also it‚Äôs a lot of busy work when applying to projects. You have to create a cover letter for each project you apply to and send your resume. The seminars are kind of annoying however the assignments we have to do are easy.   Overall I believe UROP is a great way to get your foot in the door with research. It‚Äôs a easy A like the others said. I gained skills that I didn‚Äôt have before. I learned how to use photoshop, I like my research team and I get paid for it and it‚Äôs something I can add on my resume for grad school .I never had research experience before so I‚Äôm glad I joined UROP.
comment,New Student,positive,I did Changing Gears UROP this year (I transferred this year) and I didn‚Äôt have a good experience, but my case is more rare. I basically did nothing the entire time because my PI didn‚Äôt care about the project, but I would still recommend Changing Gears because it will get you research experience and I know that apart from my experience, it‚Äôs a good program. The seminars and assignments (like making a resume, responding to discussion posts, etc) are a waste of time but the research project part of it is great.

post,Miscellaneous,positive,so I‚Äôm doing emt training through hva over the summer. I was wondering what the workload is like? thinking about taking a class during spring along with the training, but wanted to get some perspective from other people first. thank you!!
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I took the class at HVA over the summer a couple years ago while taking Chem 210/211 in the spring and a bio class in the summer, all while working like 20 hours a week at the same time. It‚Äôs definitely manageable (especially if you‚Äôve already taken an anatomy/physiology class, which covers a lot of the basic EMT class material) although it can get a lot busier in the second half of the summer when you have to schedule your clinical shifts (I think it was 7 or 8 shifts - each 12 hours long), but if you‚Äôre not taking classes in the summer half term then that‚Äôs no problem. Anyways, it‚Äôs not too bad and you should be fine, there were a lot of Umich/eastern/wcc students in my class when I took it and many were also taking summer classes. Don‚Äôt forget to get your flu shot if you haven‚Äôt already! You need it to start clinicals and it can be harder to get one in the summer for obvious reasons and I know a couple of people in my class struggled with that. Good luck!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,By the way, a few EMT‚Äôs including myself have revitalized a former student organization called the ‚ÄúMichigan EMS Club‚Äù. The purpose of the organization is to help provide educational experiences to those interested in healthcare professions where we plan to provide a wide array of opportunities like CPR/AED certification, guest speakers, and volunteer opportunities. Also, along with promoting public education as well, we have many contacts with people from HVA along with resources to help you study for your NREMT!   https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/memsc  We are currently having short monthly to bi-monthly zoom meetings but plan on doing a lot more in person activities next semester!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Currently doing training with a 16 credit winter semester including chem215. Legitimately not that bad, and I'm procrastinating with a ton of anime too. If you stay alert during lab sessions you will do fine. The out-of-lab work takes maybe 6h/week if you're devoted, although it can be completed in less time if you've got to crunch for a midterm/final. I've heard the classes are basically doubling in size for the spring/summer, so I bet you're going to meet a lot of people. All the best to you, and stay in shape!
post,New Student,negative,I'm an incoming freshman for the fall, and I was wondering whether registering for classes is only done at orientation, or if it can be done beforehand. I'm stressed that I'll miss out on all the classes I want if I wait 'til then. Any advice?
comment,New Student,neutral,You can‚Äôt register till after orientation
comment,New Student,positive,Don‚Äôt worry the big intro classes you will likely be taking will still have room, and as for fun classes, there are TONS of first year seminars that sound really fun but us non-freshmen can‚Äôt register for because they are saved for you guys. You won‚Äôt be getting into any super high demand classes, but there will still be plenty of options (although I recommend getting an early orientation date bc some of the courses that don‚Äôt have their enrollment controlled will fill up earlier)
comment,New Student,neutral,You can "backpack" classes in advance (this is basically you bookmarking them on your Umich account to find them later), but you do the actual course registration at orientation. Bear in mind that "backpacking" a class does *not* reserve a seat for you, and the course may fill up before orientation when you register.
post,Housing,positive,What co-ops would you guys recommend for a (young) masters student? I know Baker and Escher are known for having lots of grad students but wanted to know if any other houses would work as well? Any insight or experiences would be really helpful!
comment,Housing,neutral,Minnie‚Äôs maybe?
comment,Housing,positive,You normally can find one or a few at most houses! we had two in mine last year, if you‚Äôre young and don‚Äôt mind being around a range of junior/senior and some sophomores, i‚Äôd say go with the house you like the vibe of the most and it‚Äôll work!
post,Prospective Student,positive,I am a prospective student and I have been unable to visit campus. Therefore, I have been unable to see what campus life is actually like. So, I have some questions for anyone who would like to answer.  1. Does the average student seem to lean more towards the geeky, academic-focused, nerdy type or the traditional, college is all about partying and having fun type?  2. Do you feel like the large number of students has made it easier or harder to make friends? Is it easy to meet people/make friends?  3. How are the class sizes? Are the classes with many students tougher to manage? Do you feel like you can get help if you need it?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,1. Sometime I meet people and wonder how they even graduated high school bc they are always jacked up and other times I‚Äôll meet students and I wonder if they do anything but study. However the VAST majority are well rounded people that study hard but know how to have fun.   2. I‚Äôm a freshman and lived in the dorms during this pandemic and I still managed to make a bunch of friends, and I think that says a lot about the community here. If you make an effort to say hi to people, you don‚Äôt need to worry about making friends (disclaimer I haven‚Äôt experience big in person classes or in person clubs so idk how much that affects everything, bit I doubt extra interaction makes it harder to meet people)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I think the answer to 1 and 2 depend on what college/major you're in although I do think that because the university is so big with so many different people you'll find your fit whatever you want that to be.  I think you do need to be proactive about making friends either by joining clubs or talking to people but during your first year everyone is looking to make friends.   Classes vary a lot although most intro/first year classes are big. Big classes normally = more resources
comment,Prospective Student,positive,>Does the average student seem to lean more towards the geeky, academic-focused, nerdy type or the traditional, college is all about partying and having fun type?  Absolutely depends on who you hang out with. You'll find the partyers in Greek-life frats. I was never in a frat or social group, so I suppose I fell into the "academic-focused" group.  >Do you feel like the large number of students has made it easier or harder to make friends? Is it easy to meet people/make friends?  Definitely harder, but then again I was never really trying to find friends. Again, "academic-focused" and all that. In truth, I did like the large number of students because it allowed me to blend in a bit more.  >How are the class sizes? Are the classes with many students tougher to manage? Do you feel like you can get help if you need it?  Lower-level and required courses tend to be very big, often 200+ students in the course. There'll be a professor, and multiple (usually 5+ in classes of these sizes) "Grad Student Instructors" (GSIs) who will run discussion sections and are available to answer questions. You'll be placed in a discussion section that meets once a week, and who your GSI is will be based on that section.  Upper level courses are definitely smaller and also more focused in scope. "Seminar"-type classes are often only 30 students, no discussion section, and no GSIs - just the professor and their students. I did have one *very specialized* course in my final semester where (technically speaking) there were only two students registered for the course - myself and another senior.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,For the first question, there are all kinds of kids here so you‚Äôll find your people. Partying is definitely here if that‚Äôs your scene too.  Large population here means you‚Äôll be able to find your people and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs quite easy to stick with those you like and stay away from those you don‚Äôt  Lots of classes are large especially early on but they always do their best to have office hours and help. Lots of large classes have discussion section to go over material in the lecture in smaller groups too.
post,Degree,negative,I applied for graduation but I don‚Äôt know what date that is? I know psychology department commencement is April 30th. Is that my official graduation date then?  Sorry if stupid question lol
comment,Degree,neutral,No, the degree conferral date is not necessarily the date of your commencement ceremony. You should ask your academic advisor and/or Newnan.   https://lsa.umich.edu/advising/graduation/deadlines-timelines.html  https://lsa.umich.edu/advising/graduation/graduation-vs-commencement.html
post,Event,positive,Anyone know when the winners will be announced?
post,New Student,negative,I have an exam coming up and literally have not been able to study at all. I don't know what's wrong with me but I have barely been able to do anything other than mindless activities this semester. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail this class despite only taking 13 credits and I'm still doing poorly in my other classes. I'm sure in the grand scheme of things failing isn't going to be a big deal but I can't stop worrying. I'm only a freshman (in CoE) so classes are only going to get harder and I don't want to be stuck in a constant state of stress but unable to focus on anything. How bad will it be if I pass/fail almost all my credits this semester?
comment,New Student,neutral,It sounds like you may be dealing with mental health issues. Which is very understandable given the circumstances. Have you considered talking to someone (a doctor, a counselor, an academic advisor) to help see if there are things you could try to improve your ability to focus?   Whatever happens on your exam, you will be okay. Failing a class or two doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve failed at life. And a C isn‚Äôt a failing grade, or a sign that you can‚Äôt complete your degree.
comment,New Student,positive,Old engineering grad here. I failed a course, retook it, and I think scraped through with a C- or something my second time. Sucked for my GPA, but I think I still wound up with a bit under a 3.5, and I'm honestly not sure if any employer ever asked the university for a transcript. Grades are not as important as graduating, and after your first job or two, experience is probably more important than either. And I think if anyone looks at your transcript, and sees pass/fails in 2020 or 2021, they'll immediately attribute it to the pandemic, and it won't be any kind of a red flag like it might be other years.  So yeah, it's perfectly okay to fail, especially during the pandemic.  I'd be hypervigilant if you sense the same thing happening the next semester you have classes, and withdraw from half or maybe all of them early, until you can get a handle on whatever mental health issues are hindering your performance. Hopefully you're just experiencing pandemic-related stress that will dissipate by this summer.
comment,New Student,positive,who gives a shit, everyone has failed at something in their life. a bunch of numbers on a piece of paper doesnt define you. some of the dumbest people i know who got mediocre grades in university have great jobs they are totally unqualified for because of people they knew, not what marks they got. good luck
comment,New Student,positive,You can gain a lot from having to recover from failure.  You can learn resilience, how to turn a bad situation around, how to identify and admit gaps in your own understanding, and how to ask for help.  These are really useful and important skills to have.  Students who only know success in college may graduate with these skills less developed than you will.     You can come back from this.  A difficult year doesn't have to end your prospects.  Coming out on the other side will be helpful in your self-confidence and a pretty good lesson to talk about in interviews.
comment,New Student,negative,I failed calc 1 as a freshman and only got a C when I retook it sophomore year. I'm now interning at Amazon this summer and have done well in all my EECS classes. You'll be fine, just learn from your mistakes
comment,New Student,positive,Sorry that's happening to you, and I can relate pretty hard :( I got put on academic probation and failed a class after being burnt out 1 year ago, but I'll be able to graduate this semester and got a job lined up that I'm happy about.  This isn't probably what you want to hear, but it's probably best and your future self could benefit from you just trying to cram as much as you can right now. I work best with some combination of structure, fear, and motivation by assessing what's at stake, so I'll share some thoughts about your options.  This semester is P/F, so even if you don't pass then you learned more and are more likely to pass next time. Because of this, I'd either do whatever I could possible or just completely checkout. You could also only focus on one or two and salvage whatever you can this way. Remember you'll save yourself/your parents tuition money and possibly won't need to retake at least some classes, and be able to move on to something else quicker or be less stressed out because your courseload won't be as heavy.  Like another poster mentioned, I would try talking to someone (even just a friend or stranger online) to try to improve your focus as well. Good luck!

post,Prospective Student,positive,I was wondering what kind of courses I would be able to get out of with some AP credit. I've taken AP Bio, AP CS A, AP Lit, AB calc. And I'm-currently going to take apush, ap lang, ap physics C, and Ap Latin and was wondering which of these exams if not all would be useful to take. Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hey, Congratulations!! I think you'll find this link helpful:   [https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/ap-ib-credit/ap-guidelines#LSA](https://admissions.umich.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/ap-ib-credit/ap-guidelines#LSA)     Go Blue!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Given you've taken AP CS, I'd strongly recommend testing out of EECS 183 (our intro CS course) and enrolling in EECS 280. EECS 183 spend most of the time on syntax, formal logic, and eventually covering classes, all things you've seen before. AB Calc can also be helpful for getting out of Math 115 (Calc I) and getting into Math 116 (Calc II).  &#x200B;  I took a good chunk of those APs when I was in high school and nearly all of them were converted to useless ungraded credits, unfortunately.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Calc is the only one that will help. LSA is money crazed and wants to make it as difficult as possible to graduate early, so almost all ap credit only counts for elective and not distribution. AP credit sometimes makes it so you can take higher level classes but that‚Äôs about all that they offer
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hey congrats! Did you apply RD or ED
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hey guys! A few days I got into UMich, and do be honest it's always been like a dream school but I never felt a particular draw towards it. Now, I look back and tbh it's an amazing option even though I was never truly considering it. A few hours ago I got an email about the UMich LSA Honors College, and I was wondering if any of you guys are in it, and if so what's so special about it. I don't really understand it, and any information would be super super helpful! Another side note: I want to do public health and I know UMich is really awesome for public health, so I was wondering how the honors college is different than the "regular" school, and if so, how I might be able to approach the essay questions.  &#x200B;  Thanks so much!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The South Quad housing is not necessarily guaranteed, just very likely. The honors program does a bunch of social things throughout the year. They have some recently-published book discussions, talks for premed people, and some other random things (for example, there‚Äôs an origami night coming up). I‚Äôm not sure what they do in non-covid times though.  Your advisor will be an honors advisor. I think your first year writing requirement has to be an honors-specific one, but the one I took (Honors 240 Wellness) was pretty interesting and didn‚Äôt even have much writing. The courses that are like Honors ### are specifically for the honors program, but you can still take like Physics 160 (Honors Physics I) without being in the honors program.  I know they said they didn‚Äôt look too hard at standardized test scores, so I think admissions is a lot about the essays. A few people I talked to and I all did kind of out-of-the-box things for our essays, maybe taking a creative risk if that makes sense. Congrats and good luck if you apply!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It‚Äôs not a separate college. It‚Äôs the LSA Honors Program, a program for students who are enrolled in the College of LSA.  There are a lot of posts on LSA Honors if you search the subreddit.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you get into honors, you have a guaranteed spot in south quad (one of the closest dorms to central campus).  Many freshmen end up dorming on north campus, which is 2 miles from central ‚Äî maybe a 15-20 minute commute between waiting for a bus and riding it, which ain‚Äôt super fun in the winter.  Beyond that, I saw no benefit in honors and stopped after my first semester.  That being said, my college path was a very boring straight line into the business world so YMMV if you want to go into policy, consulting, education, what you will.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I sort of did it and I would definitely do it again. This information is 4ish years old so maybe things have changed, but I doubt it.  Firstly, and to me most importantly, you're guaranteed South Quad which is a great location. And you're also going to be housed with other honors students, which was a really great time for me. I made all of my friends through the program.  Secondly, and maybe this matters less to you, but most specifically honors classes are significantly less work and embrace alternate learning styles. I'm not talking about regular calc vs honors calc (that will be a big difference in difficulty), but the honors core classes you're required to take to stay in the program are generally pretty laid back and good for distributions.  Now, the reason I said I sort of did it is because I ended up not completing it and didn't receive the sophomore award (or whatever it's called). It has a high GPA requirement (3.7?) And you need to take 4 honors core classes and 4 other honors classes. I wasnt on track for either and it wasnt really important to me.  But I'm very happy I had the opportunity to take those classes, meet those people, and live in that dorm.

comment,Class,positive,Does anyone know anything about EECS 498-004 Advanced Graph Algorithms?
comment,Class,positive,Any recommendations for easy 400 level Econ electives?
comment,Class,positive,I'm an Anthro senior going into my final semester in the fall. I have 2 courses decided but I need 5 more credits to complete my credit requirement. Any interesting course recommendations?
comment,Class,positive,I apologize if this has already been answered but I can‚Äôt seem to find it. Is there a calendar with date and time for scheduling priority according to number of credits earned? I know I have seen this in prior semesters.
comment,Class,positive,Anyone know an easy flexible technical elective for an EECS senior? I need it to be 4 credits, and any suggestions would be appreciated!
comment,Class,positive,Anyone know how likely it is to get off the waitlist for an MDE? I don't think people usually sign up for more than one MDE as safety, so the odds seem relatively low... If anyone could provide some realistic chances of me getting off that'd be awesome.
comment,Class,positive,What‚Äôs easier? STATS 412 or 425? It‚Äôs for engineering technical elective
comment,Class,positive,My registration date is super late now because of the AP credit change, and I had been taking fewer credits per semester because I already had a bunch transferring in. What ULCS classes are even worth it that don't get filled up extremely quickly? My registration date is April 12th now, with only 55 credits taken here. I've taken 445 and 442, but it seems like I'll have to wait so long for 485 now. Do they give overrides for people planning on graduating earlier? After 2 more semesters I was planning on graduating.
comment,Class,neutral,Thoughts on EECS 281 with physics 140? Is that doable?
comment,Class,positive,Recommendations for Easy ULWR?
comment,Class,neutral,are so many lectures usually in lorchüò≥üò≥I've never even heard of that building (fall semester - are locations still being decided?)
comment,Class,positive,Any ez and/or interesting 2 credit humanities courses available during spring term ?
comment,Class,positive,How is EECS 489 and/or EECS 491 in terms of things like usefulness, content, interest, and workload?  Would you recommend EECS 489 and/or EECS 491?
comment,Class,positive,I'm going to be a 3rd year student majoring in CS-Eng and minoring in math. Anyone know which of the upper level Math classes are "easier" aka don't have a rep for destroying GPAs? Also if they have a good prof teaching that'd be great cause I had a really bad experience with a shitty prof teaching a great math class last sem. thanks!
comment,Class,positive,Has anyone taken PHYSICS/CMPLXSYS 445 on information theory? I think the topic seems super interesting, but I'm planning on taking EECS 445, EECS 477, and STATS 426, so I am worried about the workload.
comment,Class,neutral,Do I just fill out the form on the BSI website if I want to take core level SI classes if I‚Äôm not a BSI major yet?
comment,Class,positive,Has anyone taken EECS 498-003 Applied Parallel Programming with GPUs? What's the workload like?
comment,Class,positive,What are some really easy and low time commitment 3 credit or less SS, NS, or ID classes
comment,Class,neutral,I'm trying to figure out how to fill my distribution reqs for lsa, what exactly is the 'mathematical and symbolic analysis' requirment option? I took calculus a few years ago, would that count?
comment,Class,negative,I have a noon registration time. I am STRESSED, there are 3 remaining seats in a class I need for my major at some point next year, and this school is hideously overenrolled and I am upset. Every 60 minutes, upon refreshing, seats tick away.   That is all.   P.S. ~~If I'm in the top few waitlist spots for PSYCH 449, am I likely to get in?~~ I'm in!!
comment,Class,positive,How similar are Math 565 and Math 465? 565 looks more interesting to me, but idk how hard it would be without 465. For reference, I'm doing CSE but I plan to take a lot of math classes since I want to enter CS research.
comment,Class,neutral,Graetz or Diaz for EECS 203?
comment,Class,neutral,How is EECS 281 in spring?
comment,Class,positive,For fall 21, should I take EECS 281 with EECS 376 or EECS 370? I don‚Äôt want to take both 376 and 370 next winter. I‚Äôve heard the deadlines for 281 and 370 overlap and I haven‚Äôt heard anything good about 376 in general (also eecs 203 is going fine for me rn). Plus fall 21 is going to be my first semester on campus (though I‚Äôll be a sophomore lol) so I don‚Äôt know how heavy 281 and 376 would be together. Any advice?
comment,Class,neutral,Should I take Physics 240 at WCC over the summer or here in the Fall?  I was taking a look at WCC, and the classes are each 3 and half hours long!  Three days a week as well.  Is Physics 240 really bad enough to justify a schedule like that at WCC?
comment,Class,neutral,Should I register for Paul Zimmerman or Theodore Goodson III's section of Chem 260?
comment,Class,neutral,Can anyone comment on taking Chem 216 in Spring online?
comment,Class,positive,I'm doing CS + Math, but I'm wondering what sections of Math would be the most useful or are "must takes" for CS research. Here is a list of areas listed by UM [https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/Course-Enrollment/graduate-courses-by-area.html](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/Course-Enrollment/graduate-courses-by-area.html)
comment,Class,positive,My plan is to take EECS 281 this spring, but I need 6 credits to be full-time for financial reasons, I was wondering if anyone knew any easy 2 credit courses during the spring, or if i should take 2 mini courses (1 credit each).
comment,Class,positive,Are EECS 481 and 492 useful/worth taking? How is the workload for each?
comment,Class,positive,Anyone have any thoughts on whether I should take EECS 441 (Mobile App Dev) with Soloway or EECS 497 (Human Centered SW Dev) with Ringenberg for my CS capstone? None of the other ones really interest me that much tbh.  Also wondering if anyone had any input on if I was only going to take one of the two, should I take EECS 483 (Compilers) or EECS 490 (programming languages) for an ULCS?  Was also wondering if anyone had any experience to share about EECS 498 special topics for Applied Parallel Programming with GPUs. Thanks!
comment,Class,neutral,I'm trying to decide between ME 461 (Automatic Control) and ME 456 (Tissue Mechanics), which are tragically offered at the exact same time. Does anyone have insight into what either of these classes are like/workload/interesting projects/etc?
comment,Class,positive,Hey everybody, I am a student tasked with making a student "how-to" guide for registering for courses. I was curious if anybody had any tips and tricks they would like to share that I can add to the guide to make it easier for freshman and transfer students to choose classes. Thank you!
comment,Class,neutral,Has anyone taken Climate 102: Extreme Weather in the past year? If so, did the professor require synchronous attendance?
comment,Class,positive,How is the workload for SI 339? It seems like an interesting class plus I want to learn Web Design. But, I‚Äôll be taking EECS 281 and 2 easy classes with it in the fall. Will it be manageable?
comment,Class,neutral,Does this workload seem manageable: chem 210/211, physics 250/251, pubpol 201, and asianlan 115?  Also, for 210 should I take soellener, coppola, or wolfe?
comment,Class,neutral,Just wondering: did we get a new system for schedule builder? When I used it this semester I am redirected to Atlas.
comment,Class,positive,I was wondering what the easiest/ lowest workload ULWRs are. I'm not a particularly great writer and have a pretty high workload for next year. My major doesn't have a particular requirement or any ULWRs tailored to it.
comment,Class,positive,How much work is EECS 482 6 credit vs 4 credit? I've heard the 6 credit one is better because the 2 extra credits of content implemented in projects also shows up in the exams, but would love some opinions.   Also, is EECS 493 really as easy as everyone says? How much time are you spending on it per week?
comment,Class,neutral,Is it OK to take Math 423 without having taken Math 217 in the past? It's only a prereq, but I'm wondering if I'll struggle a lot with only 214 under my belt.
comment,Class,positive,Anyone know the chances of getting into EECS 485 with a registration date on April 12th?
comment,Class,neutral,Has anyone here taken Anthrcul 254? How was it?
comment,Class,positive,Is Stats 250 a big workload class? In comparison to math 115 would you say it‚Äôs harder or easier?
comment,Class,positive,Is this gonna be too much? EECS 481, EECS 485, STATS 412, TCHNCLCOM 300.  12 credits
comment,Class,positive,Any neuroscience majors know or have advice for what electives are the most interesting without a crazy workload
comment,Class,positive,I'm a CS minor and Computation CogSci LSA student. I'm deciding what classes to take my final semester (Fall 2021). I will be taking three classes: EECS minor elective, CogSci track requirement, and CogSci elective (I'll explain since most people aren't familiar with Computation CogSci and EECS class overlap). Here are my options:  * EECS minor elective: 100% taking EECS 485 * CogSci track requirement: Can either take CogSci 445 (I hear it's pretty easy) or EECS 492 (I've heard mixed reviews on the quality and difficulty) * CogSci elective: Will either take EECS 498: (Special topics course- Conversational AI-Principles and Practice of Virtual Assistant AI), or I will take an easier class (SI elective).  I don't know anyone who has taken EECS 498, or that topic course specifically. I really want to take the course, but I don't know how the workload would be with possibly 2 other EECS courses (492 and 485).  My main questions are for those of you who have taken EECS 492 or that 498 topic course: What were your experiences with the course/what would be your recommendations?  If EECS 498 is a really good class, would it be too much to take it with 492 and 485? Should I take CogSci 445 instead of EECS 492, if I take EECS 498?  Finally, I am a little weary about 498 due to it being taught by Jason Mars...  Thank you in advance!
comment,Class,positive,Does anyone have any recommendations for a 500 level course that is kind of an introduction or covers the broad topic of sustainability and sustainability manufacturing? I'm currently in the IOE masters program and I'm interested in learning more about this and wasn't able to find a 3 credit course I could take.
comment,Class,positive,How feasible is my schedule? I'm thinking of EECS 201, EECS 370, German 386, PSYCH 223, and Tchnclcm 300, so a little bit of a light workload. I'm a CS major trying to minor in entrepreneurship and will be a sophomore next year. I'm a little worried I won't be able to get into German 386 because of the AP credit registration time change (I have 42 legitimate credits completed by registration standards), so is there an easier 300-level humanities class to get into?
comment,Class,neutral,does anyone know if this schedule will be manageable?   MATH 525, EECS 281, ECON 401, ECON 451
comment,Class,positive,MATH 215?  I have AP credit for MATH 120 & 121 (calc I and 2), and I got a 5 on the BC exam without much difficulty, but I haven‚Äôt taken any math here yet. I just found out that one of the grad programs I‚Äôm planning on applying to requires multi-variable calculus, so I‚Äôm wondering if it would be feasible for me to take (and pass) MATH 215 here or at another university without doing MATH 116.  For reference, I‚Äôll be taking ARABIC 201, PUBPOL 320, PUBPOL 330, and PUBPOL 476 next semester

comment,Class,positive,Has anyone taken EECS 428: Quantum Nanotechnology? What was it like?
comment,Class,neutral,Incoming sophomore who decided to be pre-med. Is taking CHEM 130/125/126 during the summer doable? I've taken one chem class in high school.
comment,Class,neutral,Anyone took CLCIV 393? How was it?
comment,Class,neutral,Is taking Econ 402 and Econ 251 at the same time doable?
comment,Class,positive,Is it better to do   EECS 281 and EECS 370   Or   EECS 281 and EECS 376
comment,Class,neutral,For anyone who has taken chem 216 lab in person, do you really work on the lab for 4 whole hours? I'm trying to bulid my schedule, and this class is really making it hard.
comment,Class,positive,Does anyone have any suggestions for easy/fun upper level writing courses?
comment,Class,neutral,Does anyone know how difficult it normally is to acquire spring classes? I‚Äôm really worried because I have a late registration class (April 14th) and I really want my classes haha
comment,Class,positive,what are the microbiology classes here? And which of them are the easiest.
comment,Class,positive,If I took MCDB 310 in place of CHEM 351 do I still need to take CHEM 352 if I want to fulfill my BMS degree?
comment,Class,negative,Did the course guide crash
comment,Class,positive,hey im a new freshman so im not sure how it works lol but does this mean we can start registering for classes?
comment,Class,positive,Should I take Econ 401 in the spring with Zamzow or in the fall with Miller? Here‚Äôs my pros cons (setting aside financial aid):  Spring: -Zamzow is a great professor -covid grading (can take a pass if needed) -open note exams -con: half term = double the speed. super intensive. -con: it‚Äôd start just at the beginning of the summer and I‚Äôm already burnt out  fall: -normal semester pacing. Less intensive. -would have had a full summer to rest and prepare for school -in person, safe semester so better mental health state  -cons: Miller isn‚Äôt as good as Zamzow I‚Äôve heard. Also it‚Äôs in person meaning not open note. No covid grading procedures (no pass for low grades).   I‚Äôm torn. Any advice?
comment,Class,positive,I want to take a really light course load next semester (to compensate for this waste of a year). I know I need to take eecs 281 and Spanish, but I‚Äôm trying to decided what else to take. I want a lot of free time for weekends and football, so should I take just one 4 credit distribution class (I‚Äôm thinking SI 110) which would mean 12 total credits or do you guys think I could fit in another 3 credit distribution (15 total credits) and still have a good amount of free time?  (I might get a low commitment job or continue my research too)  For reference, I‚Äôm in eecs 203, eecs 280, stats 250, 2 credits of UROP and ala 170(super easy) and I have almost zero free time now :(
comment,Class,neutral,Does anyone have experience or thoughts on taking STATS 426 without taking 425? I have taken STATS 412 and I have the prerequisites to take 426, but I know most people take 425 first.
comment,Class,negative,Civil Engineering student coming back from a year off:  Spring/Summer: CEE 211 (spring), EECS 203 (spring/summer), ECON 101 (summer)  Fall 2021: EECS 280, CEE 212, CEE 265, CEE 325. Any civil engineers have opinions of these classes together? I know EECS 280 will take up a lot of time, but I want to know how work-intensive the other classes are and if I should delay taking one of them to a later semester.
comment,Class,positive,Any recommendations on easy FYWR that sophomores can take?

comment,Class,positive,Could anybody give insight on EECS 445 vs EECS 492? Mainly, which did you find more useful, interesting, fun, easy, tedious, etc.?
comment,Class,neutral,Does anyone know when school of information decisions come out??
comment,Class,negative,Is STATS 250 that bad at umich? I can take it this summer at a CC but I‚Äôm already taking calc 1, and worried I might be too busy. Should I avoid taking STATS250 at umich?
comment,Class,neutral,Can anyone who has taken EECS 489 chime in on how the class is? I‚Äôve heard really mixed things about it.
comment,Class,positive,Thoughts on Math 417? Looking to take an advanced math for engineering and I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of classes are heavy on linear algebra problems and I didn‚Äôt take 214/217, so I want to take some lin alg to get better at it  Edit: I already took stats 412 and want another advanced math for SUGS
comment,Class,positive,1. I have to take one eecs course outside my path, what was your favorite UL that you've taken?  2. Which eecs would you suggest: 482, 484, 485
comment,Class,positive,Any thoughts on taking EECS 482 and EECS 485 at the same time? My other class would be very low workload. I know 482 is a high-workload class, how does 485 compare? Similar to 281?  Also, is it possible to do the projects in both classes solo? There was a post not too long ago (reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lzx7ks/is_it_possible_to_do_the_projects_in_eecs_489_and/) that mentioned doing 482 projects solo might have been a better experience.
comment,Class,negative,Planning on taking spring semester and was gonna take math 316 (diff eq) and was wondering if I would die adding on math 451 (adv. calc I). Has anyone taken these together?
comment,Class,negative,If I absolutely have to take a summer class, which one would suck less: EECS 281 or EECS 270 or MATH 216?
comment,Class,positive,And do any of you guys have any ideas as to what in-person classes will be offered this summer? I am basically looking for an excuse to come to campus lol
comment,Class,neutral,Is EECS 475 curved?
comment,Class,positive,Looking like I'm gonna be taking MATH 215 at WCC and EECS 203 over the summer with some other school.  My fall semester is gonna be: STATS 206 Intro to Data Science, EECS 280 Programming and Intro Data Structures, ASIANLAN 115 Hindi I, and ALA 210 Defining Critical Global Issues.  That's 13 credits total, which seems really doable right? I was thinking about adding Math 425 but I don't think I want to take 17 credit hours.
comment,Class,neutral,german/ftvm 333 or slavic/rchums 312 for ulwr, race and ethnicity, and humanities?
comment,Class,positive,What‚Äôs a good non-history humanities credit that‚Äôs pretty interesting? History major here.
comment,Class,positive,what is the best course you have taken in Asian study about china?
comment,Class,positive,1. Is STATS 280 not going to be offered in the near future? I was hoping it would be offered next semester because I need to take an equivalent of STATS 250 and I don't want to lose my STATS 180 credit, but it doesn't seem like it's offered next semester, and it wasn't offered this semester either.  2. Thoughts on ENVIRON 201 as a natural science class for a non-science major? Any other recommendations for a natural science class that an economics or public policy major might find interesting? 3. Anyone have experience with QMSS 201, or the QMSS minor in general?
comment,Class,neutral,Can anyone explain the difference between eecs 445 and eecs 492 (or even 545/592)?
comment,Class,neutral,Fall Bio 171 or 172?  Does anyone have any recommendations one way or another on Bio 171 or 172 for Fall 2021? The 171 instructor is Meghan Duffy and the 172 instructor is Gyorgyi Csankovszki. I have read terrible reviews about both courses but I have to take it for my major. I‚Äôm not sure if the instructors change for Winter 2022 and if I should wait until then, but I would rather do it during the fall. Thank you!
comment,Class,positive,Hi! I'm planning on my freshman 1st semester course load being:  * Prog & Intro Data Structures (EECS 280) * Discrete Math (EECS 203) * Engineering 100 (Requirement) * General Elective/Intellectual Breadth (idk?)  Do you have advice for any of these classes? My main concern is EECS 280 because I plan on testing into it with an AP CSA credit, meaning I only have Java experience. Is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Any recommendations for elective/intellectual breadth classes? What are the Eng 100 classes like and are certain sections more ideal than others (Intro to Autonomous Electronic Systems caught my eye)?
comment,Class,neutral,which one is more doable  eecs 370, eecs 376, eecs 481  or  eecs 370, eecs 481, eecs 485
comment,Class,neutral, Has anyone taken chem 370 before? And how does it compare to chem 230? I'm not trying to take pchem
comment,Class,neutral,is it possible to take EECS 370 as a non-COE undergrad ? I'm ross junior.
comment,Class,positive,What is another good ULCS to take with EECS 482. I‚Äôm considering EECS 483, EECS 490, or EECS 489.
comment,Class,positive,Anyone recommend a good 3 credit humanities ulwr thats not too much of a workload, and would anyone think 281 and 370 in spring would be a bad idea?
comment,Class,neutral,[removed]
comment,Class,positive,Hoping to take EECS 481 and 485 in the Fall but in case 485 is full what would be another ULCS that pairs well with 481? I have already taken EECS 370 & 376.

comment,Class,neutral,Any recommendations for 500 level IOE classes?
comment,Class,positive,Any recommendations on interesting courses for a last semester senior with little work?

comment,Class,positive,Can someone let me know if this schedule is doable or is this too much for Fall 2021?  Econ 402, Stats 250, Econ 441, Phil 101.  If someone has taken Econ 461 could you pm me?  Thanks
comment,Class,positive,Recommendations for fun and easy HU and/or race and ethnicity classes?
comment,Class,neutral,Anyone know about EEB 390 or chem 370?
comment,Class,positive,Is this too much: EECS 281, MCDB 310, Chem 230?  I know this is only 11 credits, and I've confirmed that there's no finaid issue
comment,Class,neutral,i thought eecs 489 only required 281 and 370. now it needs 482? dang
comment,Class,neutral,Any HU recommendations?
comment,Class,neutral,Anyone know roughly when full descriptions (professor, book, etc.)  should come out on the course guide for the classes which don't have them yet (spring)?
comment,Class,positive,Which one is better for the spring, EECS 370 or EECS 376?
comment,Class,positive,Are EECS 281 labs optional/recorded?   The ones that fit my schedule all happen to be right after my other classes on central, and I just realized that bus travel time is once again a scheduling consideration.
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm planning to take EECS 281, EECS 370, STATS 250, and a 4 credit humanities course. First off, is this schedule manageable? Would it be better if I replaced EECS 370 with 376? And lastly, if I added in a natural science 1 credit minicourse on top of this schedule, would I be able to manage or is that too much?
comment,Class,positive,Wait, is this for the fall 2021 registration as well?
comment,Class,positive,This fall semester I have to take Movesci 219 (a writing course that is 3 credits). I'm bouncing between three courses to take because they're all hefty and I'm not sure what combo to take but I want to take 2 of the 3 big classes next semester.  I'm looking at Anatomy 403 (the big boy anatomy, 5 creds), Orgo 1 and lab (together is 5 creds), and Physics 135 and it's lab (together is also 5 creds).  Anybody have thoughts/recommendations on what combinations might not kill me? lol

comment,Class,positive,What are some of the easiest ulcs or flex techs to take?
comment,Class,positive,good language classes ? intensive language courses worth it ? i want to learn Norwegian or Danish, but i noticed Michigan offers Swedish and that interests me. I‚Äôve heard good things about Dutch and German too, although Russian and the uncommonly learned European languages seem interesting too.
comment,Class,positive,Would taking IOE 536, 543, and 541 in one semester be too much work or not manageable?   Other than that if I get into IOE 548 (6 credits), I was considering taking that, IOE 536 and IOE 541 next semester. How would that be?

comment,Class,positive,What are some good EECS flex-tech 200 level courses? I need 2 to take alongside 281 that aren't too crazy in workload. Thanks!
comment,Class,positive,How does this course schedule look?  EECS 215, EECS 280, Physics 340, and History 328 (w/ prof. Wells)  Also, which of the 280 professors do you recommend to take  - Profs. Saleem, Juett, Beaumont, Almomani? I've heard great things about Juett but not much about the rest.
comment,Class,positive,Hello everyone, I am gonna be a freshman this fall. I‚Äôve heard that backpacking starts today (3/24), but I haven‚Äôt gotten any emails about that. Is this for current students only? Or is it for incoming students as well? Thank you!
comment,Class,positive,Anyone have any fav ULCSs or flex techs? I need 8 more credits of flex techs and idk what to take.   For reference, I've already taken 388, 442, 481, 485, 494 (and I dropped 482 one sem so not looking to try again lol) so if you've liked any others please let me know!
comment,Class,neutral,is it possible to pull off EECS 281 plus MATH 214 in the Spring?
comment,Class,positive,What do the SPCE classes look like? How difficult usually are they? Would love to hear some experiences before I begin in the fall
comment,Class,neutral,What is the difference between English 124 and 125? Also, are there any other FYWR recommendations?
comment,Class,positive,I was hoping someone could give me some insight into the following EECS classes in terms of exam (exist or pure project based) and workload. I am looking into EECS 460, 461, 300, 301, 442, and 370. If anyone has information on these classes and what to watch out for in terms of pairing let me know. Thanks!
comment,Class,neutral,How does EECS 376, EECS 370, EECS 493, and EECS 442 for Fall 2021. 442 and 493 seem to have an A average on atlas and a relatively low workload so I was thinking taking it with 370+376 could be doable but please correct me if I am wrong and if I should hold off on taking 376 or another class.  Since I'm going to be a Sophomore and with the AP credit change will there even be available seats for me in 442 or 493?
comment,Class,positive,When I add EECS 485 to my schedule builder it puts it at the top and says it runs all week 1am - 1am but the lab has a normal time-slot. Does that mean the lecture is remote?
comment,Class,neutral,How much work is EECS 494? I was thinking of doing it for my capstone, along with EECS 496 + TCHNCLCM 497. Would there still be room in my schedule for another light/moderate ULCS?
comment,Class,positive,Has anyone taken the equivalent of Chem 130 at WCC? Required for CE, and I'm not sure if I have to take two classes to transfer for 130 or not
comment,Class,positive,Any mcdb majors know where I could find a sample four-year plan? Or if anyone would be willing to share theirs just for reference? I'm just a bit overwhelmed by the course requirements pdf and I thought seeing them organized by year might help
comment,Class,positive,I plan on taking EECS 370 and EECS 376 next semester, would you recommend I take Upper Level Writing next semester or take some easier workload class?
comment,Class,negative,Would taking ME 235, 240, and 250 plus a filler class in the same semester be suicide?
comment,Class,neutral,Would EECS 489, MDE class (prolly either EECS 497 or 441), EECS 376, and TC 497/EECS 496 be doable?
comment,Class,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Class,neutral,Would I be behind in the course of I took Calc 4 at Washtenaw before taking any Calc 3?
comment,Class,neutral,Has anyone here taken Globalizing Consumer Cultures (Anthrcul 328 )? How was the class?
comment,Class,negative,How feasible is my schedule next semester? CHEM 262, CHEM 351, CHEM 352, CHEM 260. I'm scared that this is too much.
comment,Class,positive,I saw on the eecs 285 syllabus that there are 4 projects that they give you \~2 weeks to do, and the professor gives the classic "start early" advice. How big of a time commitment are the projects in that class? Also any general advice/experiences with 285 would be greatly appreciated :)
comment,Class,positive,Just FYI there‚Äôs a recurrent typo (3 instead of 4) in the latter half of the undergrad registration dates
comment,Class,neutral,Also has anyone taken econ 102 over the summer?
comment,Class,neutral,For anyone who has taken Che 230 or Matscie 220, do you know if the discussion sections are mandatory?  Edit: I have checked and previous terms syllabi are not available.
comment,Class,positive,Which prof should I go with for ECON 101? I'm not an econ major so I'd like the easiest prof :)
comment,Class,positive,Thoughts on taking MATH 115 and CHEM 215 at the same time? Can I add CHEM 303 to the list? Thanks!
comment,Class,positive,-  anyone taken ASTR406 , EARTH468, or AEROSP567? these all cover data analysis techniques but i've got no background in astronomy, earth science, or aerospace eng, so i'm curious how much of the course material is theory / general knowledge vs. applications  -  also curious if anyone has taken PHIL414 / MATH481 / MATH681. curious how PHIL414 might stack up to a logic course from the math department in terms of rigor / depth.  - what is the stats 426 workload like?
comment,Class,neutral,Question about EECS 485. Are all lectures recorded and if I am registered for a section with one professor can I watch the lectures for the other professor?  Are the exams the same for all sections?
comment,Class,positive,best professor for stats 425?  also how much of cal 3 is really needed/used in stats 425?
comment,Class,neutral,Has anyone taken physics 535 general relativity? How it is? I plan to take physics 441 535 405 and astro 406 next semester.
comment,Class,positive,Is it really necessary to take classes like EECS 482 and 445? I feel like these are very popular and people always talk about how they‚Äôre ‚Äúmust take‚Äù classes (more so about 482). All of my upper levels have been on the easier side and I feel like I‚Äôve learned a ton in them, but would I be screwing myself by not taking something like 482 before graduating?
comment,Class,positive,I'll be a junior double majoring in both CS and DS in Engineering, and I'm planning to take EECS 445, 442, 493, and STATS 406 (all total 15 credits) in the fall. How does this schedule sound?  Additionally, how are 442, 445, and 406 in terms of difficulty? I've heard 493 is pretty easy. If anyone also has insight on double-counting EECS courses between majors that would be much appreciated.
comment,Class,neutral,How hard is FIN 302?
comment,Class,neutral,How about takeing EECS 402, EECS 505, STATS 415, SI 618 and a mathematical course about stochastic process in 2021 Fall?
comment,Class,neutral,How would Math 490, EECS 482, and EECS 485 be together?
comment,Class,neutral,Anyone take Micrbiol 405 in online format? If so, how was it and are all professors listed on the course guide teaching the same class?
comment,Class,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Class,positive,Easy ulwr for fall? Data science major and econ minor but don‚Äôt want to do subject specific ulwr
comment,Class,neutral,When can undergrads start registering for classes?
comment,Class,neutral,Thoughts on EECS 370 and 376 over the spring?
comment,Class,positive,Has anyone taken WGS 211? What did you think about the class and the workload? It looks like an easy class, but I can't find a syllabus to actually measure the workload, difficulty, etc.
comment,Class,positive,What do people who have taken EECS 473 think about its workload. Were the hours per week reasonable? If you know a decent amount about EECS 470, is it comparable to that class or somewhat easier?
comment,Class,positive,Would it be crazy to take Chem 216 (2 credits), Physics 135 (4 credits), and Physics 136 (1 credit) for the Spring semester? And would it be even crazier to take some kind of humanities or similar class (anywhere from 1-4 credits) on top of it? Any advice or comment on workload would be appreciated!!
comment,Class,positive,UX student looking to build their portfolio, can anyone recommend classes with cool coding/design projects that aren‚Äôt super intensive?
comment,Class,positive,Looking for recommendations on most painless/easiest econ 300 levels.  Currently looking at 310 with Dudek but RMP rating seems questionable.
comment,Class,neutral,How long does it take to get overrides for SI classes? They still haven‚Äôt replied back to my email
comment,Class,neutral,Is attendance required for eecs 497?
comment,Class,positive,I'm currently a student that lives about an hour from ann arbor but pays OOS. To try and save money, I am going to try and take as many classes online and then drive to ann arbor 1-2 times a week for labs, discussions, exams, etc for the fall semester.  If anyone has any information about the difficulty and or how interesting these classes are, please let me know:  CLCIV 392 - Francesca Schironi  Earth 222 - Michela Arnaboldi  Econ 310 - Maciej Dudek  Environ 201 - John Benedict  Ling 111 - Ezra Keshet
comment,Class,positive,Does anyone have any information about ME360? What I‚Äôve read online is very mixed so I‚Äôm not sure what to expect
comment,Class,positive,Is EECS 485 easier (in terms of concepts and workload) than 281?
comment,Class,positive,Thoughts on taking econ 402 before 401 this summer?   I can't attend the spring session (401 is offered then but not summer) and am trying to knock credits out fast since I'm gonna be missing several semesters starting next year due to being national guard.   My plan would be to take 402 and 370 for a total of 7 credits, and my thinking is that worst case I can take a P for/mask 402 (and 370 seems pretty easy as far as I can tell). Would masking a major-integral class like 402 cause issues for grad (law) school and/or does the department frown on it?
comment,Class,positive, Has anyone here taken CMPLXSYS 270? I'm thinking about looking at the Complex Systems minor, and I thought it would be a good class to see if I like the program. What is the workload like?
comment,Class,positive,Would EECS 482, 497, Tech comm 497, and Math 423 be doable? I'm also considering subbing 489 or 442 for 482 so if I don't take 482 which one of 489 or 442 is the better class?
comment,Class,neutral,I'm thinking of taking EECS 370 over the summer. Compared to taking full time classes during fall or winter semester, is it more work because the content is all compressed? Would I be able to work part-time while taking classes?
comment,Class,neutral,I have one more ULCS course to take before I graduate, any suggestions? Ive already taken 388, 475, 485, and 493
comment,Class,neutral,Do the eecs 215 labs really go on for 3 hours, or does it usually end early?
comment,Class,negative,Anyone have thoughts on taking EECS 482 and EECS 485?   Is this a death combo? Would EECS 482 + 481 be more manageable?   I‚Äôd only be taking these 2 courses along with one cushion course.   (If it‚Äôs really that bad, would studying for 485 over the summer offset the added difficulty, making this course combo possible?)
post,Degree,neutral,Does anyone know when Ford BA decisions will be released? I know they list the end of March on their website, but I was wondering if anyone knew anything more specific.

post,Finances,positive,UM need-based grants other than need based scholarships such as GBG. I don‚Äôt have any UM grants other than HAIL scholarship. For instance, if i apply to private scholarship will the value of my Pell Grant decrease? or will the value of my HAIL scholarship decrease considering i don‚Äôt have additional UM grants
comment,Finances,neutral,Depends on your EFC and unmet need
comment,Finances,positive,Read the fine print on your Hail Scholarship specifically looking for anything that says "if your total aid exceeds your EFC"
post,Class,neutral,Any tips, suggestions, what to study carefully? Exam is tomorrow and this class is so confusing because of how theyre teaching this semester
comment,Class,positive,I mean they're literally giving us 24 hours to do the exam so once it opens just look at the questions that are on it and study those lol
comment,Class,neutral,Is this a serious question
comment,Class,negative,Can you elaborate on how they are teaching this semester? How is the workload and difficulty?
comment,Class,negative,They usually give out a review sheet before each exam. Do those and you will be fine. This is probably one of the less stressful eecs exams
post,Prospective Student,neutral,
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Yeah, I got accepted on Friday to COE. Pretty excited and already put my deposit down!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I've seen a few but deferred decisions are released on a rolling basis (usually Fridays) until April.
post,New Student,positive,hey guys so i‚Äôm committed to lsa for the class of ‚Äò25! currently my plan is to major in econ (ik you don‚Äôt declare as a freshman) and (tentatively) plan on going to grad school for an MPP.  i‚Äôd thought about doing econ & the new ford school public policy minor, but i‚Äôm beginning to wonder if having a strong basis in stem might be useful too. does anyone know how feasible an econ major and cs minor would be? is that a popular pairing? any thoughts would be welcome
comment,New Student,positive,I think it's a fairly popular I think
comment,New Student,neutral,Also, you may want to check the new [QMSS minor](https://lsa.umich.edu/qmss) (Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences) as another option.
post,Student Organization,positive,Maybe it's just me and my perception, but I'm in clubs that did not require an application. With one exception, they all have some kind of professional intent  (building some professional skill) they pile on "social events" on top of their already kinda time consuming clubs and I'm just like, your club is an extension of school at this point, and I frankly don't want to go to these social events because in my head, it jsut seems like it'll feel the same as club time . . .  I dunno man, I jsut want to make friends, so I joined clubs, but I feel like most are more of an extension of school or not a lot of actual talking, just banter, IDK. It's hard to plan shit outside of clubs.  I dunno, sorry, I jsut couldn't sleep last night because I felt so , fucking alone, after putting in all of this effort to put myself out there. I don't always have the energy to go to social clubs on top of school work, maybe it's my depression but it doesn't feel worth it.
comment,Student Organization,positive,> they all have some kind of professional intent   Yeah, that's your problem.  Your experience really depends on the type of clubs you join. A majority of the professionally-focused clubs are like an extension of school, where you pay dues, attend events, network, and everyone tries to get a position on the board as resume padding. I know this from experience because I joined several clubs like this over the years. It seemed like a lot of the people cared more about becoming club president, than they did making friends or having a fun atmosphere. The clubs that come to mind are business-related clubs, social cause based clubs,  etc.   Then there are the fun clubs (e.g. something like anime club or a fitness/weight lifting club), these are just as important. I highly recommend you seek one of these out! Find a hobby or activity you're interested in and join it. In these types of clubs, it's a lot easier to make friends when people have joined because they're passionate about a particular hobby or sport, not because they want to get a summer internship. Not everything you do has to be related to school or a resume booster. For example, you can join the outdoors club to go hiking and meet new people, not because you want to become a park ranger and need the experience.   Trust me on this one.
comment,Student Organization,positive,It‚Äôs a hard year to meet anyone But personally I also haven‚Äôt ever made good friends in professional type clubs The few good friends I met at clubs were when I was involved with club sports and it honestly took until I did a weekend trip for me to really get to know anyone well   You‚Äôre not alone in your feelings and it‚Äôs okay to pivot or pause what you‚Äôre doing if it feels fraught. It‚Äôs a hard time to meet anyone and it‚Äôs a hard time to maintain pre existing relationship
comment,Student Organization,negative,I‚Äôve felt this exact same way as I scouted clubs out. Even the clubs that are just for fun can seem intimidating right now, since all we get are usually discord servers
comment,Student Organization,positive,I think your issue is that professional clubs tend to be more rigid.  I would use maizepages to find a club that has to do with a different interest, they tend to be more laid back.  There‚Äôs a board game club that I know is still meeting online, and I think there‚Äôs a video game club as well.  There‚Äôs really a club for pretty much anything you could possibly be interested in, and those tend to be much more about the social aspect than the professional clubs!
comment,Student Organization,negative,I hate my club so much (professional frat). I'm dropping it after the semester ends.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Try some other clubs. Not every one will be a good fit for your personality and social goals. If you're not there merely to collect name cards, surely you'll do better with a club/org that's based on actually doing something, rather than networking for networking's sake.  I joined the Michigan Daily kind of on a whim. I had no plans for going into journalism (and it's not the path I followed after college). Before I knew what was happening, though, it took over my social life completely, and I'm forever grateful. Decades later I am living halfway around the planet and still meet up with Daily friends several times a year, occasions that fill me with warmth and joy. They have been my rock for my entire adult life, it's something irreplaceable and by far the most valuable thing I got from UM. From what I hear the intensity of the Daily community hasn't changed that much in the years since my time.
comment,Student Organization,neutral,I think the problem is the kind of clubs you‚Äôre joining. Try something wholly social‚Äîcasual games club, cubing club, disc golf club, fly fishing, hacky sack, Star Wars fan club, tabletop gaming, etc.
comment,Student Organization,positive,I've made a ton of really good friends through my "professional" club - the move is to keep an eye out for optional (and potentially unannounced) things   Especially with clubs that have Discords after going virtual, it really helps to see if a few people are ever just hanging out and chatting outside of official club hours and hop in   It's a lot easier to make friends when you are there outside of officially scheduled activities
comment,Student Organization,positive,Try a professional identity based club if you can! They usually dedicate part of their time just to bonding and venting, and it's nice to be around people who are similar to you in experience.
post,New Student,positive,I will be a freshman this fall and was wondering which classes I can use AP credit for med school requirements.   Edit: i plan on majoring in chem or biochem   I took chem last year and might take bio exam this year. Could I get credit for bio too, or should I not take the exam?  I also have Calc BC and Stats for AP credit and took Calc 3 and Linear Algebra this year from community college as dual enrollment. Would I have to take another math class at UM?  Thanks!
comment,New Student,positive,I highly recommend taking the AP Bio exam. It gets you out of two intro biology classes here and saves a ton of time. Assuming you‚Äôre planning a biology major and not like biomedical engineering, you‚Äôve taken all the math you‚Äôll need. You will need to take two semesters of physics but it‚Äôs far less intensive than a true math course. I hope this is helpful, let me know if you have any other questions!
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I'm a premed student (MCDB major for now) and I need to take one of these two classes. Which one should I take? Is one harder than the other? Will one help me on the MCAT more than the other? I plan to take either one during junior year. Thanks!!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I think 230 is supposed to be the prehealth one, but I'm not 100% sure about that
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Are they a premed req?
post,Housing,positive,What are your thoughts on the YOUnion apartments? Their four-bedroom units seem pretty decent in comparison to other spots from what I've looked into but before I do anything I'd like to know some pros/cons of the place from anyone that's lived there or heard anything about it.
comment,Housing,positive,I live here now and enjoy it, feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions!
comment,Housing,negative,I lived there before it was called YOUnion. I disliked it, but everything is relative. For student housing it‚Äôs really not all that bad but I found it really stuffy and suffocating and really hated that you couldn‚Äôt really open windows there. It also annoyed me that you could only pick up packages when the office was open. I‚Äôm also not sure how the price compares to the other high rises there but I think the other high rises are considerably better. Ended off moving to a studio off campus that was in an older, dingier building but really loved having so much more space to myself for the same price in rent.

post,Sports,negative,How crazy was the streets of Ann Arbor when we went to the  final round in 2018 for basketball?
comment,Sports,positive,Definitely one of my favorite moments of being at u of m. South U was flooded with people, I distinctly remember some guy climbing a lamppost right outside of charlie's. Really just a wild and all around great time, the energy was almost palpable.
comment,Sports,positive,Absolute pandemonium. My roommates and I headed down to South U area right after the game that sent us to the final four and you could barely move. People climbing lampposts and go blue chants... great vibes. At the rate Juwan is recruiting it looks somewhat likely you‚Äôll get to experience it yourself!
comment,Sports,negative,Struggling to find articles now, but I distinctly remember something about street lamp poles being greased in the final four and finals so people wouldn't climb up them after the game.
comment,Sports,positive,Still cannot believe I was in Seattle for an internship that winter semester. Went to a Michigan bar out there and that was awesome but I really would've loved to be in Ann Arbor.
comment,Sports,negative,I can tell you how nuts it was in 1992 and 1993...  1993 was the second time I was teargassed.  First was ND weekend in 1991.

comment,Sports,neutral,I‚Äôll never forget storming the diag in 2013
comment,Sports,negative,The biggest basketball riot I recall was in '89. Damages were estimated at around $100,000. After that, the city put up much stronger street lamps, with steel-guarded lights centered directly above the pole, and giant concrete planters to replace throwable benches. From an [mlive recap](https://www.mlive.com/news/erry-2018/04/e0cc0a2ccb/last_time_michigan_won_the_cha.html) of the riot:  * An awning was ripped off a South U restaurant * Part of the roof of a bookstore collapsed * A taxi was spray painted and flipped on its roof * Street light poles and signs were torn down * Several parked cars were stomped on and damaged * At least five store windows were smashed * A number of store rooftops and awnings were damaged * A fire truck was brought in to help disperse the crowd, only to have hoses pulled off the truck
comment,Sports,negative,I vaguely remember police on rooftops of restaurants/businesses as I was heading back. This was after UM lost to Villanova (we went to Chrisler to watch it on TV there) so it wasn‚Äôt hectic
comment,Sports,positive,My friends went to get tables at brown jug right when they opened. I personally ended up staying there for like 14 hours. We were on channel 4 news too which was cool. It was an absolutely glorious day (except for the loss).
comment,Sports,positive,Dude don‚Äôt jinx it. Please.
comment,Sports,neutral,Yup, was there. Everyone was out on the streets climbing the street lamp poles
comment,Sports,negative,Things were crazy in '13
comment,Sports,neutral,I remember as a student and a lifelong fan from Ann arbor, I just watched it while bowling deep on jackson street during it to escape the madness, no pun intended
comment,Sports,negative,My parents were both in Ann Arbor when we actually won the whole tournament in the late 80's and people were literally rioting outside of Ricks, trashing cars and shit.
comment,Sports,positive,Absolutely wild, I remember leaving from Charlie's and the whole South U area was completely packed. Distinctly remember seeing people climbing the street poles, which was great lol.  I left towards Main Street to meet up with some other friends at a different bar and totally lost my voice shouting "GO BLUE!" back and forth with random people on the walk over. That entire tournament run was such a blast, so many great memories!
comment,Sports,positive,It was great lmao
comment,Sports,positive,right after the game I was sitting in the espresso royale on south U, studying for an exam, when suddenly blue and red lights flashed into the cafe from the police cars blocking off the street outside. the energy was everywhere- people flowed all over the sidewalks and streets like a massive maize wave. pretty amazing night!
comment,Sports,positive,Really good energy and crowded streets. Everyone was in a good mood in general. You had to wait a long time for food bc everyone went out at the same time. High fives with random people in the street. The good stuff.
comment,Sports,positive,Oh it was wild. All the South U bars emptied out right onto the intersection of south u and church and basically just a mob of people for an hour or 2. People were climbing poles, celebrating, and just amassing in large in joy and unity. Go Blue!

post,Student Organization,positive,I just received an invitation to join [Phi Kappa Phi](https://www.umphikappaphi.umich.edu/), an honor society at UofM. It seems legit given the official website. But is joining an honor society (for \~$100 in dues) worth it after graduation? Would it impact graduate admissions or future job prospects?
comment,Student Organization,negative,No. It does nothing other than take your money. These are pretty much just a scam
comment,Student Organization,positive,Don‚Äôt join, it‚Äôs a vacuum for money
comment,Student Organization,positive,People are saying these are a scam but they are what you take out of them. Phi Kappa Phi is an actual legit one and UMich will put it on your transcript. I joined Phi Beta Kappa, which is similar, and membership in it (and PKP) factors into the federal hiring process, which helped me get my current job. They also have networking events that you can attend that are different than UMich Alumni ones. You might not get a job just because you're in it but it is a thing to have in common with people that helps break the ice in networking, which then might in turn help out. If you just join and don't engage in any of the events or resources it might not be worth it, but it's not without any benefits. I personally don't regret spending the one time $90 dues, but not everyone will find it useful.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Talked with the PI (research professor) I work under, as I was also invited to a similar honor society listed on U-M transcript (Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, Tau Beta Pi), and if you intend to continue in academia or graduate school, it does seem like it has value. Basically, I was told that some individuals in academia (for context, we were talking specifically about MD/PhD admissions committees) do place some importance on these seemingly meaningless honor societies, so if the financial burden is not excessive, there is no reason not to join.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Yes! Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa are only two you should pay for!
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello everyone! I have recently been admitted to the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor for Fall 2021 . I am an international applicant..I've been admitted to LSA with an intended major of computer science. Even tho I haven't committed yet, I'm 99% sure I'll end up at Umich.  Can anybody please help me by letting me know their experience at umich? Also, I had a few doubts about how to double major...declare your major..honors colleges.. internships etc?  Kindly guide me on the same. Thanks :)
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Fight to stay on central campus. You will not regret it. You will have to take the bus a lot, but you will get the full Umich experience.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Also not international, and I‚Äôm a stamps major. But I am a freshman and I have a peculiar story as to how I chose UMich. If you have questions about covid or other general questions about what campus is like feel free to dm me!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,International student here. For the internship, I‚Äôd say it is hard to target one for freshmen. Try to finish the sequence 183-281, i.e take 281 in the spring and aim for one in sophomore year. Also, if possible, apply for TRANSFER to college of engineering. There is a difference for international students if you are at cOE or LSA for Cs major. It should not be that hard as most of friends do get into cOe from LSA. Just put hard work and get good grades.   Do not worry about double in LSA, as long as you get good grades in prerequisites of that major, you should be absolutely fine.  Declaring major usually happens when you are done with prerequisites. I‚Äôd suggest wait until the end of freshmen year to talk with adviser and so on.   For honors college, it depends on what kind of honors that you want to do. Honors college provides you with somewhat different educational experience and that is what you need to apply for. There are a lot of honors major and they are decided by department adviser and only look into grades and potential to succeed in the major. But they are essentially not much different from a traditional major, perhaps just a thesis or courses difference.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As a URM and someone who potentially has ADHD it turns out, I had a pretty shitty time. I struggled to make friends, even pre covid, I've found better people though, Classes here are  touigh, and there's soo much to learn. If you want to  switch or double major in a different school, you gotta take certain classes and it's not guranteed you'll get into the major. Dinnig halls are nice, good friends potentially, people lioke sports but you won't get shamed if you don't. Get a coat for winter. Huge progressive culture where if you have a slightly more nuanced opinio n, you'll feel fairly singled out. Tyhere are resources like CEW+ that helps minorities, also CSP for math particularly. Every department has their own tutoring program.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Not international but I'm a cs major graduating this year, feel free to dm me about cs stuff
comment,Prospective Student,positive,There‚Äôs generally pretty good access to internships around your sophomore or junior year, although I wouldn‚Äôt expect that as a freshman. It may be harder if you‚Äôre international and don‚Äôt have the appropriate work status, though.  Declaring majors at Michigan is easy and you can change your major as much as you want. The main thing to keep track of, particularly in STEM, are the pre-reqs. Double majoring (within LSA) is also straightforward.   Honors college is not really essential to a rigorous academic experience, but is a good option if you want smaller, in-depth classes and more social ties with like-minded people. Entering honors junior/senior year and doing an honors thesis often makes more sense.   If you have any specific questions beyond that, do let me know.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Michigan is truly home. The amount opportunity you will find here will launch straight to success while having a crazy amount of fun along the way
comment,Prospective Student,positive,hi! international student here, got accepted early this year for the class of '25 into LSA. congrats on ur acceptance!
post,Prospective Student,positive,I was considering doing a major in both Math and CSE, but I heard from a friend that I would have to fulfil all of the LSA requirements such as humanities, writing, and so on if I wanted to get a Math major while being enrolled in CoE. I also saw that LSA does not allow AP Credits to fulfil a lot of their requirements. Is this true? Ideally I would like to just take math classes and not have my schedule bogged down by classes that don't really interest me.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,This is largely accurate.  However, you can get a BS in computer science from lsa, and thus not have to complete both sets of prerequisite requirements.   Alternatively, you can minor in math.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I graduated with my math undergrad/masters some time ago and took a few courses in the CS department. I would strongly recommend majoring in CS through LSA if this is the path you are going down; the major requirements are identical and you don't need to take a myriad of engineering classes (2 semesters of physics, a semester of chem, capstone, engin 100, etc.). Recruiters and graduate schools alike do not differentiate between CS-LSA and CS-CoE, so why would you want to? CS-LSA exists solely for people like you who want to double major in another non-engineering discipline. Plus, the time you save taking 2 sets of pre-reqs can be better spent taking graduate/topics courses in whatever subfield(s) of math and/or CS you find interesting.  A number of my friends in the math department were CS double majors and found the workload to be doable, though depending on how intense you want your time at Michigan to be, there can be some particularly difficult semesters. I'd recommend meeting with a math advisor and/or a CS advisor to try and plan out your schedule.   Also, kind of a separate point but I do have some more specific advice; if you already have even a little programming experience, try to test out of EECS 183. It's a fantastic course for introducing programming, but it's painfully slow if you've coded before. Also, I would strongly recommend taking Math 465 over EECS 203. 203 is an awfully run course where you don't learn anything, whereas Math 465 can count towards your math degree, is taught by a real professor in a small class, and is genuinely very interesting. The workload is a bit higher, but given that your option is Math 465 or EECS 203 + another math course at some point, 465 is the clear favorite.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Joint degree student in math (LSA) and computer science (CoE) here.  Yes, you have to fulfill all of the LSA requirements. You can double count with engineering, but that doesn't help too much (except maybe with natural science).  You're also correct that AP credits don't count towards the requirement. You can use them to fulfill course requirements and the like, but it didn't count towards the number of credits you have to take in certain subjects. For example, if you have credit for AP chemistry, it won't count towards natural sciences.  As Veauros mentioned, you can do your CS major through LSA, although that'll only help with removing some of the engineering requirements (there aren't that many). A math minor is also a very good option -- it only requires a few math classes, but there's no reason that you have to stop taking math classes once you've finished it. Then just list your course experience on your resume or whatever.

post,Class,positive,I‚Äôve started to study for the eecs 281 midterm and am finding myself in a difficult situation. I can figure out the majority of multiple choice questions quite easily but the written practice has been killing me. Even the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù questions that aren‚Äôt exam questions but general practice have been rough. It seems like I can‚Äôt solve any of them and that I have no ability to get better at doing them. Can I please get some tips on how to get better at the written problems and coming up with the algorithm I need? I want to just keep trying but I am not improving with practice. It seems like it‚Äôs something you either get or you don‚Äôt.
comment,Class,positive,Leetcode. Set a time limit for yourself so you‚Äôre not staring at them for hours, as that‚Äôs not helpful either. It‚Äôs problem pattern matching, so try to come up with and think about the different categories that exist, how to recognize them, what bag of tricks you can use for each, what kind you need to practice more, etc. try solving them on an actual whiteboard and talking through what you‚Äôre thinking
comment,Class,neutral,This is one of the things I strongly disliked about this class. It is very much you get the answer in 30 seconds or sit there staring blankly. I would try running through every data structure you learned so far and think carefully about how you could apply it to the problem with special consideration of maps and vectors, as they‚Äôre the two you‚Äôll most commonly use. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try thinking about how a modified form of an algorithm learned in class could help solve the problem.

Its so sad that people think they deserve an **A** for trying; it would be more understandable if it was a B, or hell even a B+. As OP said, if you're struggling w the pandemic, come back later. Don't expect grades to be handed out for free

comment,Meme,positive,some of you guys don't understand the meaning of compassion or sympathy, and it shows. some people lost their family this pandemic, some people lost their homes, and some were hospitalized for COVID. not everyone could leave and come back because (surprise) this university wouldn't refund your tuition unless you paid for insurance. so no, not everyone has the economic privilege to do their best right now, or come back later when they have a chance to do their best.   yes, in the real world police murder black people for doing nothing, immigrants are held in concentration camps, and poor people stay poor because their schools are underfunded their parents make minimum wage. that doesn't give you license to be a dick. be better.
comment,Meme,positive,yes it‚Äôs a pandemic. No one is enjoying it. But a pandemic doesn‚Äôt mean you should just pass classes just for trying. It‚Äôs college not a feel good participation award academy. If you‚Äôre not learning effectively, try again post pandemic. Welcome to the real world.
comment,Meme,positive,Sad, I wish we taught an actual liberal arts education, then the ppl in Eng/Sci would have enough Critical Theory to understand why they've been wired to think their educational trauma is good :'(  Edit: y'all the trauma was not __what__ you were taught, it's __how__ you were subjected to learning it. Thanks for all the reiteration that tech education is super important and should probably steer away from pushing it's products into mental spiral (which similarly to lack of knowledge negatively impacts the bridges, surgeries airplanes, etc) though! =)
comment,Meme,positive,What is even everyone‚Äôs objection, that it‚Äôs unfair to give everyone the same grade? What about the dozens of ways that our current system of grading is unfair? Is it fair that students working to pay for college have to compete against students whose parents pay for them? Is it fair for ESL students to compete against native English speakers in classes with a lot of writing? Is it fair for students with anxiety in a class requiring a presentation?   The post that started all this was about a philosophy 101, a class likely populated by almost entirely freshmen having to stay motivated through a school year with limited to no social interaction and doubtless a great number of personal difficulties and tragedies; in a normal year over 60% of the class would get an A anyway, anyone can check that on grade guide.   I don‚Äôt know, I really don‚Äôt see this as particularly harmful to anyone involved. Could there be some other argument to make if it were an engineering course or something? Yeah, sure, but it‚Äôs not.

A is 276+, A-270-275,  B+ is 264-269, ab is 246-263, so on (last spot to get a P is 210). exams are not open book or resource.   emphasis on piazza and office hours. all the same blurbs and links you see on other syllabus about code of conduct, etc.  schedule for was us 6 lectures and 2 lab type components. the lectures are broken up into 2-7 mini lectures on one page.  edit: that is basically it, the schedule wasn‚Äôt on the syllabus.
post,Employment,positive,Hello,  I will be graduating from umich mechanical engineering this upcoming August, but do not have a full time job lined up. I was wondering if it is allowed to attend the Fall career fair as a recent grad? I cannot find this info anywhere.  &#x200B;  Thank You

comment,Employment,positive,I‚Äôm almost sure that the fair is officially restricted to current students.   https://career.engin.umich.edu/events/career-fairs/  You should contact the ECRC and ask what job search resources you can employ now, and how they can continue helping you after graduation if you need it.
post,Miscellaneous,positive,For those who‚Äôve brought their cats to campus with them, do you think it‚Äôs a good idea or is it not worth it?
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,You cannot live in a dorm with a pet. A lot of my friends have cats or small mammals as pets in their off campus apartment   Just know it‚Äôs another expense or stress. Do you potentially have the means to drop everything and drive to a vet if your car gets sick? If the answers no, maybe it should stay at your parents home.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Where are you planning on living? How anxious is your cat and how do you expect them to respond to a move? What is your financial situation? How much time do you expect to spend at home?  There are just too many variables here to make a generalization.   I do have my two cats here with me; however, I can‚Äôt unilaterally recommend that to everyone. 1. My parents live nearby in case of an emergency situation.  2. I am financially stable and have access to a car. 3. I have aspergers and anxiety/depression, so I do rely on my cats for emotional support and companionship to a greater extent than most people do.   For most people, it is probably a better idea to leave your pets with your parents for at least the first couple of years.

comment,Class,negative,Here is the full statement: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JOlP_4_SXzc4xAJE2UZR4gfknzWd-XeHv7vQTB_nQgw/mobilebasic  As someone who has genuinely contemplated suicide as a result of my education, I have never felt more seen, even though I‚Äôm not even in this GSI‚Äôs class.   I know heaps of people will make the argument that something like this is unfair to students who actually worked hard and toughed it out despite personal issues, and I would agree with you.   However, this semester, this college, my workload, the fact that I was sick for a week and now have no hopes of ever catching up, all makes me *so sad*.   If you believe that this makes me weak, or if that makes me less deserving of a good grade, or that I deserve to feel like this, all I have to say is that you are probably right to say that in our current climate. I just wish we lived in a system where having mental health issues and having difficulties are not seen as ‚Äútoo bad, try harder‚Äù. I wish that we lived in a system where you don‚Äôt have to tough through all your problems and project a facade of ease.   At this uni, there is no meaningful feedback on your coding projects, a class had a leaderboard so you can feel extra bad about your grade, and in many eecs classes no late homeworks are accepted *no matter what*. These policies don‚Äôt sound conducive to learning at all. In fact, they‚Äôre toxic on purpose.   I guess I just wish that everyone is as compassionate as this GSI, and doesn‚Äôt create unnecessary difficulties and competition just for the sake of it.
comment,Class,positive,This is pants on head on stupid.    First of all, it would be one thing if this was his class. If it's your class, it's your call, no one except the dean is going to give a damn. Your house your rules. But it's not. He's a GSI for a much larger class. Meaning this is just some self-sacrificial move as his grades will be overruled by his prof. Forget about being fired, he might find himself in front of an honor council or ethics committee of some kind for sabotaging grades. Strip away the sob story and this is a case of academic integrity plain and simple. Minus all the good intentions, this is the same as giving your friends As. Again, it would be different if it was his course to set the policies for, but it's not.    There's also the issue of the *other* discussion sections in the same course, who ostensibly aren't getting free 100s. Then the issue of fair and equitable treatment gets added. It's a disaster caused by one person playing by their own rules, which is every staff's worst nightmare.    It's not to say I don't agree with him on a lot of the issues we students are facing. But this is a bombastic, over-zealous, short-sighted way of going about addressing the issues. I know it'll be popular with students because free As is about the most stereotypical way to get students to like you. But it's idiotic.   EDIT: I want to really emphasize that my opposition is to the method, not the underlying valid intentions. I think this hits a soft spot with a lot of us because we want our instructors to be more forgiving in times of hardship. I'm definitely on board with this underlying motivation that the GSI had. But like I lay out above, I think this particular way of going about change is foolish. It's like a prison guard whose idea of prison reform is to let out all the prisoners in his cell block (apology for the school-prison analogy). What does that accomplish? The prisoners get recaptured, the guard gets hauled in front of a judge, and innocent people get caught in the crossfire.
comment,Class,negative,The subject of giving all students A's popped up early on during the pandemic, when everything went online for the first time. The simplest argument against it is it would hurt students long term as students would not have any incentive to actually work and learn the material, as well as not know how much they know. Forcing students to work their ass off during a pandemic with minimal assistance is bad, but having them advance to a follow up course, only to have no clue what they are doing and have them waste 2 semesters + 2 semesters retaking is criminal (i.e. assume you get an automatic A from Calc I, went to take Calc II with no idea what a limit or derivative is, bomb calc II and have to take both of them again). Some quick googling shows this is a philosophy class so idk how much of the material from the course is used in subsequent courses but giving everyone an auto A both dilutes individual effort and fails to give students valuable feedback. In general, if you want to make the pandemic easier on students, stop giving live exams and give take home midterms or more (and lower stakes) problem sets instead. At least that way students can learn while doing the HW/exam.
comment,Class,positive,It's hard to make definitive comments on the morality of the situation. I'm not doubting that this action comes out of the goodness of a person's heart but on the other hand it also has some serious purchasing power in terms of social standing.  I've seen this exact post shared by friends who are GSIs lauding it as great example of something we all should think about doing. Make no mistake, in certain academic circles this is the moral and righteous thing to do and this GSI is hailed as a hero.   Other people have done a good job in this thread of pointing out all the potential negative effects of this action so I'd suggest reading that. I just wanted to add that doing a good thing doesn't have to mean that a person is also not motivated by personal gain (for instance, being seen as righteous leader).
comment,Class,positive,Let‚Äôs hope she has tenure
comment,Class,positive,This is fantastic. Jesse is a friend of mine and he is genuinely one of the sweetest, most caring people I know. He cares so much about his students and about UM as a whole.  I'm really happy he did this and I hope more GSIs do it. I could not possibly imagine trying to take a class at any college right now, let alone at UM. My God, the amount of posts I've seen on this subreddit alone in the last six months makes me so worried for this year's cohort of students. I worry so, so much about how many students we are going to lose to either Covid, mental health breakdowns, or suicide.   Something has to change and I'm glad Jesse is one of the people willing to take a stand to make that change.
comment,Class,neutral,This Professor is a joke. A degree has simply become something you pay for rather than something you work for. Price is 10x higher than it used to and difficulty is 10x less than it used to.
post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I've been having some medical issues for the last few weeks and I need to talk to an advisor but I've actually not had one for the last 10 months.   Also if anyone has any advice for taking an exam at an alternate time due to an ongoing medical issue, I'd really appreciate it. Last week I was **denied** an extension on a 24hr take-home exam despite having medical documentation, so I was up till 6am finishing that when I was supposed to be getting rest before getting an MRI at the hospital.  I have another exam on Monday and I'm really trying to talk to an advisor so at least I have someone on my side of things for this one.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,You want the Dean of Students Office.   https://deanofstudents.umich.edu/critical-incidents  They‚Äôre very helpful. Contact them ASAP and they can help coordinate accommodations for you.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Are you in engineering? If so, and if you have declared your major, your academic advisors are your department‚Äôs undergraduate coordinator (staff) and undergraduate chair (faculty). If you are undeclared, then there are a number of staffers in the engineering advising center (https://advising.engin.umich.edu/) who function as academic advisors ‚Äî just email their general address.   But it sounds like academic advising is not the (only) thing you need. You may want to contact the Engineering CARE center: https://care.engin.umich.edu/
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I‚Äôm going throught the same thing right now. Thankfully i was able to get a 48 hour extension on a project, but i did have to drop a class. I randomly chose an advisor from Newman. There also is a medical reporting form on the newman advising website that provides documentatjon to all of your professors.
post,Degree,positive,On the Ross website it says "While eligible third-year students may apply, we strongly encourage you to apply at the end of your sophomore year. Preference is given to applicants with two years of coursework at a degree-seeking institution. The Business Minor is not intended to extend your academic career at U-M." I was wondering if anyone had the personal experience knows of someone who has gotten accepted for a Ross minor as a junior applying in their second semester. I'm able to finish all the courses without delaying graduation so I'm not sure if that's the reason they prefer sophomores or just the fact that they don't want juniors.

post,COVID-19,positive,i feel like all i ever do is school & it‚Äôs still never enough. i‚Äôm always behind & i feel shitty physically & mentally.   so many profs & GSIs really are doing their best to make things better for students, but this semester especially all the ‚Äúthese are unprecedented times & we will have extra grace for you‚Äù seems to have faded & all that is left is having to write papers about self-care on top of countless hours of other work. there seems to be no understanding that the weight of a pandemic isn‚Äôt magically getting lighter, it‚Äôs only getting heavier.   it‚Äôs exhausting, lonely, & frustrating.   anyway, just had to rant & wanted to see if anyone else was struggling. sometimes i feel like the only one.
comment,COVID-19,negative,I just spent about 16 hours (combined) doing an exam I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm going to do well on. Same shit every day, I feel guilty when I leave the house to go on an errand or something because I feel like I should be doing homework and studying. I want to just say fuck it and aim for a C- in all my classes to convert to a P, but I know that‚Äôs not who I am, but I‚Äôm just so sick of everything at this point. I need this remaining month and a half of classes to fly by
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Yep, they usually say "we know these are tough times" and then assign 2x more homework than is reasonable.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I feel this. Haven't had time to relax in about a month because I have so many projects to do. Any sliver of free time I have is spent exercising because I otherwise would be glued to my chair. Hopefully I'll manage, but one thing that drives me crazy is this weird illusion professors have of "taking a break". I've seen so many announcements on Canvas saying stuff like "studying is important but nothing is more important than your mental health. Take a break! Go out with friends!" but that is the most ludicrous suggestion imaginable. Do they understand how much work is being assigned to us all at once? Do they understand that there physically isn't enough time to finish assignments, study for midterms, AND take meaningful breaks? You have to choose where to spend your time, and if you want to do well then there's only one option...
comment,COVID-19,negative,I feel physically sick every day. Like literally. I can sleep 10+ hours and still feel tired and feverish. I know I'm not sick because it goes away after a few hours. But I am exhausted. I am tired. My brain is a mush most of the time....
comment,COVID-19,negative,Yeah I'm a GSI and also a student (like still taking classes and such) and I feel the same way. And it's piled on because I really wish I could extend some more grace and flexibility and understanding but I only have so much power. And I feel really bad all the time, and I'm teaching a class I'm struggling to teach (and honestly would struggle a bit if I was a student in) and the students are really struggling to grasp but again, I can only do so much; I'm just one person. And then on top of that, I've got my own grad student milestones and high stakes exams to do and pressure to work towards publications, all while I'm dealing with other life stresses that are so much more than they've ever been and honestly more than a person can handle, I think. And yet I know that I'm probably a three out of ten (if that) on the struggle scale of how much people are just hurting and dying trying to make it through, and somehow that stresses me out even **more**.   And then as it goes, all that piles on and I look at it and I just can't even bring myself to begin to tackle it all; I'm just too depressed. All I want to do is lay around all day and try not to think about everything.   I don't know what it is. I mean I do but I don't. The world is just really terrible right now and I'm not sure when, if ever, it's going to get less awful. I'm to the point where I don't know how much longer I can do this. It's just a scary world out there and stressful times.  Feels good to rant -- all that to say, know that you're far from alone.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I am having trouble deciding between UMich Ann Arbor and CMU (Carnegie Mellon) for MS in Chemical Engineering.  Any inputs would be highly appreciated!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Flip a coin. Seriously.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I don‚Äôt know much about chemical engineering so I can‚Äôt give technical advice, but I am going into grad school in engineering next year here and I have been to CMU and have a good friend there. The good thing is that you can‚Äôt make a bad choice here, both are great. I personally think the culture and environment at Michigan is more interesting and fun(maybe because it is public). Are you more interested in the research being done at CMU or Umich?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm a chem e grad student. Feel free to dm me with questions
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Having worked at both universities and lived near each, Oakland/Shadyside is a lot cheaper than Ann Arbor.  Parking is worse (if you can believe it).  From a research perspective, Michigan looks to have a better research budget than CMU, but you are competing with more people.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,What is the end goal for a career after an MS? The two schools place students slightly differently
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I'm also a ChE grad (PhD not MS, tho) feel free to DM me.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If the program is like other STEM Masters and PhD programs: Go with the best mentor (the professor you'd work with) and lab. It'll make a giant difference since you will have to work with them for several years
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Pittsburgh is a much more interesting place to live than Ann Arbor. The scenery is also 10x more beautiful. Both programs are good so consider quality of life in breaking the tie.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If money is not an issue and both schools are good, always go to the private school. They treat you so much better.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Michigan all the way!!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,CMU's robotics and CS department sorta overshadow pretty much every other engineering department there. But the campus is really nice.
post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Each of Michigan's departments is generally T20 in its respective rankings, yet the university is consistently T30 according to U.S. News.  Is Michigan harmed in the rankings by not being as diverse as UCLA and UCB?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Private school bias
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,The USNews rankings are subjective at best. Most people would consider Michigan an excellent, T20 school, and it is generally more highly regarded than Rice, WashU, UCLA, and several other schools that were, for whatever reason within the ranking methodology, placed above.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Tbh Michigan has it pretty good in its current niche. I don't think the ranking difference between UCLA/UCB and UMich is diversity though lol. I think UMich actually beats UCLA/UCB on a few of those metrics (overall it pretty much evens out to the same).  I think Michigan could be a T20 in the next 5-10 years tbh, but it wouldn't necessarily serve them well to go much beyond where UCLA/UCB currently are.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I think the more pertinent question is: why would anyone care?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Actually, the unusual thing is that UCLA cracked the top 20.  it's hard for public universities to attain that ranking because their size works against them (expenditure per student, class size, and alumni giving all tend to be less advantageous in the equation, for publics).  I think more people would consider Berkeley and UCLA to be UM peers, rather than schools that are meaningfully better.     You asked about their diversity.  I assume you mean the social mobility that USN&WR includes now--it tries to get at how well "under-served" students do at the school.  It's a little complicated because some measures include those who transfer in (like some of their debt calculations) but most include only those who started as freshmen.  Thanks to the California System, UCLA and Berkeley have a big cadre of transfer students.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,If your school is ranked T20 in general rankings but T40 in your major specific rankings, is it truly better than being in a T40 school that ranks T20 in your major? General rankings take into account a multitude of factors including rankings of multiple departments taken together. If your university is a T10 history school, does it truly benefit you if you are majoring in Physics or Chemistry (or the other way around, i.e. would you go to CalTech to study history) ? General rankings are good for eyeballing the overall quality of different schools but brake down when you compare schools that are closer together (i.e. UofM is clearly better than MSU in terms of general and most department specific rankings but the same cannot be said for UofM vs UCLA/UCB as certain departments are rank higher and certain departments rank lower).

post,Health / Wellness,negative,Basically the title. I stupidly neglected to get my hair cut where I normally do in my hometown over winter break, and now my hair is ridiculously long and needs it desperately.  I've never gotten my hair done in AA before and don't know any good and reputable places. I asked some friends of mine where they go but they were all girls and most of them said their stylist only deals with women's hair. So if anyone has any suggestions/knows any good places for men's hair, it would be greatly appreciated, because frankly my head is staring to look a little ridiculous.

comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Arcade Barbers is pretty great, they're my current go-to. You'll have to schedule an appointment though.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,If you have a car, check the gentlemans barbershop on platt and Packard. They do all kind of cuts for all kinds of hair textures
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,My experience with a few places:  * Arcade Barbers: Easily been my go-to for a solid cut under $20 * Campus Barber: Russian Roulette if you're scheduling a random person, you'll either be fine or get a... rather... memorable haircut experience. * Aveda: Really solid, but I pretty much only go if I need something extra done like highlights or dye because it's quarantine and I've lost my mind   There's also Varsity Barber, which all of my housemates went to pretty regularly and I have plenty of guy friends that really dig it.  So yeah, uh, check out Arcade Barbers and Varsity Barbers

post,Class,positive,Hi guys I am a freshman at umich intending to study CS. However, I am facing a tremendous obstacle of passing eecs 281. I think I am understanding the concepts relatively fine; however, I am very not used to developing such heavy projects all by myself and thus am failing the project portion of the class. I really tried to start early but my mind simply wasn't there and could not focus. If I were to take this class again I wouldn't know what could've changed so I can do better as I really tired. I think I may need 90% averages across the next two projects to meet the minimum competency for passing the class. I am totally freaked out and not sure what to do. I always enjoyed technology and computers, but doing these projects are simply not my thing. I like projects that are more visual such as stuff on [code.org](https://code.org) where I build a game or simulation that I can see; not some fake simulation with mere input files and through terminal command.   &#x200B;  I am debating to either drop this class rn or drop at the very end of the course before the last day of class so I will not get a W on my official transcript nor NRC. I really like coding, but this class is making me debate whether I am able to continue study CS at Michigan, as well as my ability as a programmer and a student. I truly feel like I am overwhelmed and am screwed as a prospect CS major.
comment,Class,positive,It doesn't seem like you're really asking a question, more of a rant, but I'll offer what I can anyway.   &#x200B;  First question: how was your experience in EECS 280? p2 is visual, but not much--only the final output actually displayed anything. p3 isn't visual at all. p4 wasn't visual when I took it--I believe it was redesigned since then so I'm not sure what it's like now. p5 wasn't visual. Did you struggle at all with the same issues in 280? If so, how did you overcome it then?  &#x200B;  Second: it's not unusual to struggle with 281, but this specific issue (having a harder time with command line based projects vs visual ones) is not one I've heard often. As a second semester freshmen, you're definitely very early on 281, so don't worry about getting behind if you have to drop it. You're definitely not screwed if you can't get through 281 this semester.   &#x200B;  I see that you mentioned having trouble focusing. Is this the main reason that you're struggling with the class? You say that you tried to start early but couldn't focus--what happened next? Did you then wait a week and start again, did you try to push through, or did you wait until the last few days, do what you could, and then submit what you had hoping to get some points?  &#x200B;  Unfortunately, working with input/output files and text and command line-based programs is just part of the curriculum here (I imagine it's similar elsewhere, but I'm not sure). Even the classes you might think are more visual (i.e. 485 Web Systems) have command line-based portions to them. I think this is a hurdle you are going to have to face at some point if you want to be a CS major.  &#x200B;  Are you able to continue studying CS at Michigan? I firmly believe that anyone who has the time can succeed at CS here, so yes. What you have to decide is whether it will be worth it for *you*. It's not an easy decision to make, but I'm not sure there's much anyone can do to help you make it.   &#x200B;  I'm sorry if this comment wasn't super encouraging--I'm not very good at that, I'll leave others who are better at that to do that. I do hope you find the answers you're looking for.
comment,Class,positive,While there are visual programming paradigms, any serious CS curriculum I've heard of deals with a lot of non-visual code and data. It's one thing to have a course that's a personal weak spot (for me it was analog circuits, as part of a computer engineering major), but I feel like 281 is kind of the heart of what CS is about. Many other CS classes will be similar.  Maybe it will go better next try. In person classes might make a difference. I don't know what your pandemic experience has been, but for me, years ago, making friends in classes was valuable, seeing how different people worked, having casual conversations with classmates in computer labs. I assume you can post questions on a class forum, but sometimes you gain insights you didn't realize you lacked just from talking, or learn about time-saving tools like autoformatters you didn't know existed.  On your self doubt as a programmer, there's a difference between CS and programming. Many exceptional programmers never went to college, and I've worked with solid programmers who came from unrelated fields of study. A CS education gives you a deeper understanding of a broad range of topics within the field, but you can be a successful programmer within an area of expertise without knowing anything about the fundamental concepts of computer science. Like you might learn the basics of compression algorithms in a class, but if you needed to compress some data and knew nothing about such algorithms, it's easy enough to find a library and just call a compress() function. So I wouldn't necessarily doubt your abilities or potential as a programmer, whether or not you pursue a CS major.  And regarding your self doubt as a student, you've presumably done well in classes in the past or you wouldn't have been admitted to the university. Failure in one course, or in one area of study, doesn't mean you can't succeed in another.  I'm not sure what you should do, though I'd lean toward giving it another try next fall, but even if CS doesn't work out, I wouldn't give up on an alternative major.
comment,Class,positive,If you're truly afraid you won't make it in EECS, there's always what I did: bounce to SI. I struggled enough that I just kinda hopped ships because I was looking around and going "shit, I still want a coding career but there aren't a ton of non-EECS majors here that are still coding-heavy." It's super applications-focused, and most people either end up focusing towards user-experience design or data-analytics stuff, with dashes of webdesign thrown in there.  That option noted, my retrospect is that I wish I did the EECS minor alongside SI, because the theory you learn in EECS is still super useful and you don't really get it much in SI's undergrad program (grad is different story).   So yeah, that's a non-theory-intensive, non-weeder-policy way to still have a coding-oriented undergrad without EECS. You do have to apply to cross-campus transfer into the program, but it's not that bad a process, especially if you get through 281 because you'll be able to play up having a deeper knowledge of computation that'll aid your studies.
comment,Class,positive,Lots to address here.  Firstly, you are in the unenviable position of taking 281 as a freshman during a virtual semester. No matter what way you look at it, that's going to be tough, so I think you should try not to be too hard on yourself.  Secondly, if I understand your definition of "visual projects", upper levels will be able to better cater to that preference. So if you can manage to get through 281 (and 370, I can't imagine that counts as "visual"), you'll be able to do things much more your speed.  Now, as for your struggles with the project portions of the class, are they purely founded in motivational issues or are you also struggling from a difficulty perspective as well? Getting 90s on the remaining two projects is certainly doable - if memory serves, the median for projects tended to be upper 90s - but I'm curious what you think the number one roadblock for you is here.  If it's just an inability to motivate yourself to do classes that "aren't your thing", then unfortunately that's going to be a problem down the road because the nature of college is generally that you can't escape that fate. You're a freshman taking a super challenging course (for comparison, I took 281 in my second semester of sophomore year) so you obviously have a lot of time to work through this stuff and falling behind isn't the end of the world. I just think you'd benefit from some introspection on what you think your number one issue is here.
comment,Class,positive,If you are more interested in visual projects, maybe check out some classes in the School of Information as well!
post,Prospective Student,positive,Admitted grad student exploring housing options...  How practical is it to live in Detroit and drive to campus? Seems like you can get a much better bang for your buck housing-wise. Would be moving with my partner and a dog so co-op and/or dorms are not really an option. Apartments in Ann Arbor seem overpriced for the space you get. Still want to be close to walkable neighborhood amenities like restaurants, bars, grocery, etc. Considering Midtown/ Medical Center area. If you have experience parking in the UMich lots, that would be helpful too. I don't mind the longer commute and paying the yearly fee for the garages as long as finding a spot is not impossible. Also, how far in advanced do you need to look at apartments? Thoughts?  Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice. Detroit definitely out. Going to stick to AA and maybe Yps. Doesn't seem worth the extra commute time
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I wouldn‚Äôt suggest living in Detroit for pretty much the same reason everyone else said.   Student parking won‚Äôt be that bad and the price is reasonable for the academic year, but it depends on the tier of parking you get. Since you‚Äôre going to be a grad student you‚Äôll be eligible for student yellow/after hours which is like $237 a year. Keep in mind all the parking at the heart of the campus is for faculty only, so you will need to walk 8-10 minutes or take a blue bus.  If you want to save money/bigger space I would suggest to live in north campus. You can even live in Northwood IV and V which are specific for graduate students and their families. One of the benefits is that northwood parking is only like $84 for the whole academic year and then you can take the blue bus to campus.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,You will run into traffic if you attempt that commute at peak times. Finding a space won't be a problem if you pay for a parking pass but why would you want to spend so much time commuting unnecessarily? All the money you spend on gas and potential car maintenance will add up and you can find cheaper apartments a lot closer than Detroit in places like Ypsilanti and Saline.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Maybe look for housing in ypsilanti
comment,Prospective Student,positive,honestly just like 10 mins from campus is so much cheaper
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Plenty of places close to Ann Arbor that are cheaper and probably nicer than Detroit. It's not even a nice drive either especially closer to down town.   You're going to be spending hundreds just on gas every month, and hours on the road you might as well spend working instead of driving that'll make up the differences plus gaining some experience.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I used to commute from an hour-ish away, no freeways or busy roads until I got to campus. Imo anything more than an hour and a half isn't really feasible. According to Google the fastest way is I-94, which you'll take west all the way to the exit for Ann Arbor-Saline Road. The entire commute start-finish should take about 45-50 minutes. That's assuming peak conditions though, so budget extra time due to weather or traffic accidents.  Parking pass lots are great for commuters but they don't allow overnight parking if you needed to be on campus overnight for whatever reason.   If I were you, I'd purchase a yellow parking pass (the kind only faculty/grad students can get, as opposed to the orange/undergrad parking) and park your vehicle at the Stadium. There's a bus route (Commuter North) that runs every 10 minutes (when there's no pandemic) that will take you the rest of the way to campus.   There's restaurants/bars and small grocery shops all within walking distance of central campus. If you need a larger grocery store, there's a Meijer's on Ann Arbor Saline road, but it's south of I-94. You could either drive there or take the City Bus (route 62 I believe), which are free for all university students.  _____  Tl;Dr ‚Äî The commute should be manageable. I'd recommend a parking pass, parking at the stadium, and taking Commuter North the rest of the way to campus. Amenities like restaurants and groceries are all within walking/drive distance, or along a bus route if necessary.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,This is a horrible idea. You are guaranteeing yourself daily frustration from a long commute or traffic, to be exacerbated during inclement weather, and the likelihood of feeling like an outsider in two wonderful cities, which you will never get the chance to truly know. My partner did the reverse commute for awhile and she did not enjoy it at all, but was thankful she wasn't going the other way (the way you'd be going), as traffic was consistently bad.  AA gets much cheaper as you leave the downtown area. There's a ton of cheaper housing a few miles south of downtown, but like others have said, I think you should look east, near the border of Ypsilanti. If you want to be near a dog park, the area around the Swift Run Dog Park is very cheap. Living in Ypsi is also an option, though I'd ask yourself whether you want to forego the AA experience.   I live on the edge of Ann Arbor and Ypsi and, while I love it here, realize that I missed something by not being right downtown in the thick of things. I have access to better and cheaper food by virtue of living here, but I can't walk to a million awesome places like folks living downtown can.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you want to save on rent, go to Ypsilanti, Saline, Dexter, or one of the random rural-is areas surrounding Ann Arbor.  Detroit is just way too far away for a realistic commute, and you will get very miserable very fast.   What exactly are you looking to pay? You can get a 2-bedroom apartment in Ypsi for maybe $800/month, and there is a downtown area over there that's largely pretty safe (and definitely better than Detroit.)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Could you theoretically do this? Yes. Would I advise anyone to do this? Absolutely not. You're looking at over an hour of commuting time each way at an absolute minimum, factoring in a 45-50 minute drive and a ten minute bus to campus from the lots you could actually use. And that's if everything goes absolutely perfectly: no traffic, a bus basically waiting for you exactly when you need it, good weather.... Add in some snow, or construction, or an accident, etc. and it wouldn't be hard to bump this up to an hour and a half. One way.  All the grad programs I'm familiar with at UM are pretty intense. The last thing I would advise anyone to do is add all those extra hours of commuting time, not to mention the extra stress of a daily commute like that.  Look at Ypsi for what you've said you're after. You'll still grow to hate the commute on Washtenaw or Packard if you need to travel during rush hour, but it will be a hell of a lot better than commuting from Detroit.  Plus, unless your partner is going to be making serious bank, which I'm guessing they're not cause you don't want to pay for A2 rents, you would be spending thousands on gas, car wear and maintenance, etc.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,One of the other things that could make commuting hard is that you might be less available for things that go on outside of your usual class times.  Clubs, group project meetings, grad seminars, academic talks, etc.  I know commuter students make these work, but I have to imagine that commuting from an hour away ups the challenge.  Unclear what kind of space your grad program might have for you--if you don't have an office or lounge to use on campus, then even sticking around for a thing happening a few hours after your last class could be a hassle.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Try Ypsilanti or even a 10 minute drive from campus and things will be so much cheaper. I wouldn't suggest commuting from Detroit. The commute will guarantee you daily frustration.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I have several professors who live in Detroit and obvi teach in Ann Arbor and all of them pretty much exclusively teach afternoon classes because they don‚Äôt want to get caught in morning traffic.  The drive to Detroit without traffic is like 45-50 minutes But you change highways several times in the drive so it creates a lot of pinch points for traffic
comment,Prospective Student,negative,I live in metro Detroit and I drove back to Ann Arbor on a Monday morning to get to my class at 9:00 am. In order to make it there on time I had to leave at 7:00 am. The traffic was horrible. The drive was stressful and tbh I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Plus I had a place to park so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about that. I can‚Äôt even imagine doing that every day of the week. I don‚Äôt not suggest commuting from Detroit at all

comment,Employment,positive,In 203, there's a right answer, and you just need to help people get to that one right answer. In 280, as an IA, you need to debug someone else's code, which is a lot more work than just helping someone get to that one right answer.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Edit: Would you recommend that CoE students live on North Campus during their first year?
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,No
comment,Prospective Student,positive,literally no reason to do so unless you're super invested into a design team  all your prereq math and science is going to be on central
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Most freshman engineers will only have 1 class+1 lab on North next academic year (ENGR 100+101 lab).  ENGR 101 lectures appear to be keeping the shift to remote asynchronous for F21 (and beyond?).  If you come in with credit, especially in math or science, you might take more, but for most engineers, there's no "advantage" to being on North in that respect.  North is plenty nice enough, though, and your social life isn't invariably doomed or anything‚Äîit's just a different experience.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Do not live on north campus.  As a freshman almost all your classes will be on central and having to take the bus to and from your dorm to central is a huge impediment to social activities.
post,Employment,negative,So if I can be honest, I am getting nervous. Graduation is less than two months away and I feel bamboozled. I washed out of CS and went to Math because my career counselors said math majors have great career prospects in most fields, but I've been struggling to find jobs. I've looking to go back to So Cal or STL to support family, but tech space there wants engineers, programmers, or scientists. It's so frustrating that math is universal but no one seems to be hiring.      Am I missing something? Is there some database I don't know about, or did I just make the wrong career choice?      Sorry if I'm being a downer, I'm just overwhelmed right now.
comment,Employment,positive,How much much math do you wanna do? You can be come an actuary by studying hard and passing some exams.  http://sam.math.lsa.umich.edu/workshops/  Or you can become a software developer by creating a portfolio of webapps, android apps, ios apps, etc ..  You can also apply to tons of analytical business jobs too.
comment,Employment,negative,I am faarr from being a math major, but I've also been seriously struggling to find a job--I think it's just because the market is so saturated from last years graduates having a tough time finding work, + covid layoffs.... it's a rough sea to swim in right now :(
comment,Employment,positive,You should look into some Quant finance roles if you haven't already. Programming experience + basic probability theory (425 or 525) is nice but usually not even required; most places tend to aks logic/probability questions in the interview.

Surprised, though, that so many are applauding this as a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù message.   Unsolicited advice, (Reddit‚Äôs favorite kind):  When you get screwed over by something unfair, and the person responsible does not offer an appropriate remedy or apology, you‚Äôve got the moral high ground. Don‚Äôt cede an inch of it by lashing out.  Keep it professional and factual.  You can also address how frustrating the experience has been, but you get that point across without hyperbole or personal attacks.  I note that some people have suggested that the author of this complaint have his name blurred out.  I don‚Äôt think that would be necessary if it were simply a message laying out the facts and the harmful effect on student grades & morale.  Not aiming to be an unsympathetic jackass but I‚Äôm speaking as an oldster who has seen how people get judged by how they react to adversity and conflict.  In professional communication, you will be better off taking the high road.  Vent away but then revise before hitting ‚Äúpost‚Äù or ‚Äúsend.‚Äù
comment,Class,negative,as much as i like how he signed off, i think he could have let up just a little bit (especially the personal attacks) to avoid getting into some serious trouble, while still achieving what he wanted to achieve
comment,Class,positive,Get this man an award.
comment,Class,positive,If you guys wanna check out how much any professor makes it's public information, FYI: umsalary.info
comment,Class,positive,Not a student but sometimes I look at this Reddit thread and 'Dr.' Hahn's name seems to come up and never in a good light.   Perhaps it's time for 'Dr.' Hahn to retire and find some other things to do.  It seems like faculty just doesn't want to look at the poor performance of some professors and do something about it.   Thankfully I'm not a student having to endure this BS but can remember having to endure it. And it wasn't fun (we both left on the edge of PhDs...).
comment,Class,negative,I almost did a rant like this for one of my classes this week. The exam was open for 24 hours, had two ridiculously difficult questions, and yet the professor had the gall to rarely check Piazza to answer questions. I waited 5 hours between his responses. Worse of all, his responses either: were too vague to actually help, didn‚Äôt address the question at all bc he misread it, or just refused to answer the question.  I was mildly tempted to post test answers to see if he would fucking check piazza and take it down. But I neither posted the rant nor answers bc I have integrity, unlike this jerk.  Edit: wow I just opened reddit hours later and saw the downvotes, prob bc of my second paragraph? To clarify, I was never actually going to post test answers, it was just an invasive thought borne from spite and frustration. But yeah, I shouldn‚Äôt have even mentioned it.
comment,Class,negative,In the working world you constantly are given unsolvable problems. Yet I doubt practice was the intent of the professor here.

comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,You should reach out to the school you‚Äôre applying to for clarification as to what that is. As someone whose gone through the transfer process and applied to several schools as a transfer, it‚Äôs not a term I‚Äôve heard before.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I think it might be your transcript, in that case you can send an official transcript via Wolverine Access

post,Miscellaneous,negative,Title. Days fly by like seconds and my sense of time died towards the end of last semester, so I feel like I‚Äôve lived through four Novembers. I hate it. Anyone know how to deal with this?
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Yes, I feel this way and no, I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,change of pace. Your mind is passive in things that are habit and active in things that aren‚Äôt. Try something new. Make it a habit that at least 1-2 mornings/afternoons/whatever per week you‚Äôre trying something new or adventuring someplace new whether that‚Äôs alone or with a friend
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Intense planning, meditating, and journaling. I have found all these three are somehow pushing me to think about what I have accomplished today and ideas for tmrw.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Everyone's sense of time has been warped since the pandemic. Simply put, humans are not well adapted for the restricted living that we've done for the past year.       It's hard to explain since I am not an expert (and I'm probably going to have some inaccuracies) , but your sense of time is corelated to your awareness. And essentially more awarness = slower time. Naturally with our lives becoming more routine and passive (electronic media isn't as interactive as reading a book or writing etc..) our brains are conserving energy by reducing functionality.      What helped me reset my sense of time, is being outside more. Moving, finding new ways to get new place has helped. Always going to new places like a park. As humans, we're fundamentally problem solvers and we need new stimulus to try to figure out.  It's all about discovery.     Also try to pick up a new hobby, or tying to figure out a new way to do your routine.  For me, I've explored new music genres and different eras on spotify and real listened to it.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,When you do ‚Äúnew‚Äù things your brain remembers it more and the more new things u do in a period of time the slower it feels. That‚Äôs why time feels faster as you get older. When you‚Äôre young everything is new to you and time goes slow but as you get older there‚Äôs less stuff you haven‚Äôt done before. Ofc the pandemic takes this to the extreme because everyone‚Äôs in this routine every day and not doing anything new at all really. Lmao I used to be super upset abt the fact that time had started going faster when I started high school but then I learned the science behind it and the fact that it just happens when u get older.  Also I need a ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt even go here‚Äù flair lmao I feel weird commenting in this sub when I don‚Äôt even go here
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Feel the same but I love it tbh.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Yeah, I feel this way. It really doesn‚Äôt feel like a year has already passed considering all the moments I was looking forward to were cancelled and there wasn‚Äôt anything for me that would cause time to like still for a bit.
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,Questionable suggestion: inject some chaos.  I was feeling a little stuck so I texted a buddy from literal middle school and now a bunch of us swordfight on the weekends. Still got the covid feels but at least it‚Äôs a little less drab  Steal a sign, buy too many chicken nuggets, watch questionable cartoons, do some generally weird stuff to spice things up and make the days a little less identical
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Change up your routine. Doing the same things over and over again makes the days melt into each other.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,The more new/different things you do and experience, the more your brain gets to process and time feels like it‚Äôs moved longer. Since COVID has really minimized the number of things you really can do, it feels like time is just flying by you
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Feeling the same rn and have no clue how to deal with it. First year has been shooting by. Doesn‚Äôt feel great
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,I had this same issue. Then, at the beginning of this year I read the book The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry by John Mark Comer and it changed my life. The book discusses the way society idolizes hustle and hurry (especially in competitive academics) and that the best way to eliminate this--to feel more present and intimate with life--is to set time limits on social media consumption, walk slower, meditate often, read, essentially do things that old people do. I have been doing this for the past two months and I have never felt more present with life. I feel like my life is slowed down, I am able to enjoy the present, and I've become a much more loving and peaceful human being. Reading has been a key factor for me (I read the Bible each morning and a choice book each night), additionally walking slower, driving slower, and processing thoughts as well as others words in a more important manner; whereas I would've ignored the majority of others comments before. Try to slow down everything that you do--as well as take some time for silence--and see if it helps you with the sped up world we live in. It worked for me, hopefully it does for you.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,So true
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Do something different every day. Doesn‚Äôt have to be big. Just do something to make your day a little bit different from the rest, a little less monotonous. Go to the diag, cook something different, zoom a friend, try and do a handstand, heck, as long as you can look back and go ‚Äúhuh, Tuesday, that was the day I went for a walk at 2am and saw squirrels doing the do‚Äù.
post,Academics - Other Topics,negative,I physically cannot focus on the text when I'm worrying about whether or not my thoughts on it will be good enough to score points, whether or not my classmates are going to judge me, etc. I hate having to make comments and being able to see when other students have the document open too; there's just so much pressure. It makes me really uncomfortable that other students and the professor can see how long it takes me to read through, how often I have to stop and re-read, and how often I skim over other parts.   I also just read better on hardcopies but if I print these out then I have to go back over and find spots that haven't already been annotated and try to converge everything. It's so frustrating.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I don't think anyone judges anyone on Perusall we all just do what's required and leave
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Wait, the professor can see how long you took to read through it? üò≥
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,i literally write nonsense on perusall and so do all my classmates. we reply to each others‚Äô nonsense and upvote it and act like it makes sense. it sucks but once you figure out how to rig the AI, it‚Äôs not all that bad
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,My opinion as a heavy Perusalled student, break it up into two steps: reading, and annotating.  First, set comments to display just your own, and read it at your leisure; don't worry about professor surveillance. Comment your "aha" moments. Then read the next text the same way.  Ignore the sidebar. People are always hopping around struggling over there. Just read and enjoy if you can.  After, go back and turn on all the comments and engage a bit for each text/article. It'll be a bit more fun that way. If you're worried about replies on your comments, just don't look at them and leave yourself guessing. (That's avoidance behavior but it's crazy out there.)
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I don't get why faculty think that forcing students to engage with something will boost their learning. I feel like this falls into the same category as forcing students to have their webcams on during class.  Maybe instead of tuning Perusall's grading algorithm professors should spend the time trying to find engaging readings or just provide annotated summaries themselves. It's like some professors will do everything to get students to engage except make their classes more interesting.
post,Finances,negative,They said they would announce finalists in February but I haven't heard anything I just wanna know if I was rejected or not lol and the anxiety is killing me.
post,Class,neutral,I just took the midterm in Physics 340 but I wasn't able to finish it in time. I thought the questions were relatively easy but time consuming and I only had an hour to finish 6 questions, one of which was larger and took me almost half the time. I ended up missing the last two. What is the point of giving out tests if you don't allow enough time for students to finish them, and why is the physics department especially horrendous at this? Does anyone else have this experience or ways of dealing with it?
comment,Class,positive,Just took the same exam and I can definitely relate. It was frustrating knowing that the questions were relatively easy, but most of them required an insane amount of steps and time to show decent work. I barely finished in time and my work was almost unreadable. I definitely don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a well designed exam when you know the material but you don‚Äôt have enough time to write the answers. The only advice I can give is to read all of the questions and attempt the easiest/quickest ones first. Then try to write whatever you can that‚Äôs relevant for the problems you couldn‚Äôt get to, in order to get some partial credit

post,Class,positive,I know that 183 is not offered in spring, but it seems like it was offered one singular spring (2016-2017, from Atlas). Does anyone know why they did that or why they don't anymore? I'm assuming it probably just didn't work well when they tried, but just wondering if anyone knows or if there are plans to teach it in Spring again.
comment,Class,positive,Since you are interested in EECS 183. I am assuming you want to do a major/minor in cs/ce/ds. You can check out engr 101 or engr 150 depends on your coding skills. Both classes are equivalent to EECS 183. And either one counts in the program.
comment,Class,neutral,My guess would there is not enough demand because EECS 183 is generally taken by freshmen in their first school year. If you are majoring in CS/DS/CE you need 183 as a freshman because you still need two more semesters of coding classes (280 and 281) before you get to upper levels for your major so you really need it done your freshman year. The other majors that require just EECS 183 probably don't create enough demand for the department to offer a summer option.
post,Health / Wellness,negative,Hello  I‚Äôve been struggling with social anxiety for a few years now, but it‚Äôs never been something I couldn‚Äôt handle. Since covid began, I‚Äôve been spending most of my time along and currently live at home, not on campus. This has worsened my social anxiety incredibly.   I find it extremely difficult to log onto my classes or club meetings each day, and I try super hard not to speak. When I do speak, my anxiety feels so strong that I have trouble putting my words together and to say something meaningful. I sound so unintelligent compared to my peers.   When I think about returning to campus next year, I get sick. I will be living in a co-op, which I was excited for, but now I‚Äôm really really scared about the social situation there. I‚Äôm scared my social anxiety will continue to debilitate me even after I‚Äôve returned to campus.    I‚Äôm not going to write too much more of my symptoms because I don‚Äôt need to. I know I should get help. I‚Äôm not able to find a therapist right now as I‚Äôm living at home and simply cannot afford one. I was thinking about CAPS but I heard they aren‚Äôt much of a help. Does anyone who struggled with anxiety before have any advice?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Well, I had brutal anxiety for my first 4 years of undergrad, trying different approaches and medications all throughout, and in my 5th I just had one UHS visit where they had me try a cheap non-addictive anxiety medication that really corrected things and it‚Äôs been a huge help with social and performance (work, academic, presentation, competition) anxiety ever since.   So, TLDR: if you could use some help on the chemical balance side of things, give UHS a shot.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I'd recommend joining a group in the [Wolverine Support Network](https://www.umichwsn.org/). I just joined a group for the first time this semester. You meet up once a week for one hour with other students at the university. They have a lot of time slots to accompany your schedule, and there isn't any pressure to attend regularly. There are 2-3 seniors who lead the group, and they maintain a safe and comfortable environment. I really like it because it is a very low-stakes time where you can just relax and talk about whatever you want.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Hey! I'm sorry you're not feeling well these days. I've struggled with anxiety for the past few years as well and know how debilitating it can be. This past summer i had the worst anxiety I've ever experienced (I would wake up and immediately start feeling chest pain/heart palpitations), and what helped me get through it was a combination of taking an antidepressant and meditation. I feel like there's a sort of stigma around taking meds for anxiety but it seriously helped me so much, and I also started using Headspace for meditation. Obviously different things work for different people and social anxiety is a bit different, but that is what worked for me :) If you wanna talk about anything PM me! Just know that things will get better, you got this!
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Hi! I'm so sorry you're going through this. I've had social anxiety my entire life (I was a mute kindergartner!) and I've only recently started to suspect it might be more a coping mechanism for neurodivergence (trying to get tested rn, but my psychiatrist is almost certain I at least had adhd).  It's definitely impacted my experience here at UMich. I feel like I wasted my first few years here and now that I actually wanted to do something about that,,, that chance was taken from me by Covid. (also, I definitely feel you when you say quarantine has made your SAD worse--I'm almost entirely defunct if there's just a regular amount of people at the grocery store and god help me if there's someone in my same aisle).  My freshman year I was fortunate enough to live in a suite on North campus and I made really good friends with my roommates. We still talk regularly today and they've helped me learn and grow a lot. I also studied abroad, which brought me further out of my shell.  My advice to you is to try CAPS. Though it didn't work for me and my best friend (we come from a poor area and have A LOT of problems including c-ptsd, SAD, depression, GAD, attachment disorders, etc. as well as likely neurodivergence so we need a lot more than CAPS can really offer), it could very well work for you! In my experience CAPS is like, for minor counseling instead of major rework in your life.  Second piece of advice, don't let the anxiety win. Your worst enemy is also your best friend here--exposure. The more we isolate the worse it gets (not much of a choice rn though) and the more we socialize the easier it gets. I was put on Buspar recently for my own anxiety and it's been helpful for this. Just don't be like me my freshman year and cocoon yourself in comfort. Try new things. Go out from time to time, assuming we'll be able to next year. Have game and movie nights with your cohabitors. But also don't be afraid of taking time to re-energize yourself and your social battery too!  If you wanna talk more or be friends, etc, feel free to dm me!
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,My personal experience with CAPS over the last year has been very positive. Saw my therapist biweekly for the first few months and then monthly since then.   It's given me a lot of tools to help me handle a lot of my insecurities, anxieties, depresive spirals, etc. They also help you get medication if you need it.  You already pay for it, so I'd reccomend giving it a shot. If you'd rather go through an outside provider they can help you determine who takes your insurance and give you a referral.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,They have group therapy workshops specifically for social anxiety at CAPS! I‚Äôve been dissuaded from CAPS because I‚Äôve heard the same that they aren‚Äôt much help, but honestly my experience has been much better than I expected. And especially for a case like mine where I wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend therapy outside the university, it‚Äôs more valuable than people give it credit for. Any help at all is better than none.  Here‚Äôs the link to that specific group for social anxiety ([CAPS - Conquering Social Anxiety](https://caps.umich.edu/content/conquering-social-anxiety)) which I think is holding workshops that focus on building practical ways to manage and decrease social anxiety. But you could also reach out for an initial consultation where they can recommend certain resources and guide you through your options that can help your personal situation and your specific needs (which is what I did).   Best of luck!

post,New Student,positive,I‚Äôm a freshman engineer so I‚Äôve been at home for the past year, and all my time has just been work. Classes, studying, homework, exercise, wait for the next class, then chill for the night before doing it all over again.   I know everyone says ‚Äúoh your not in person, it‚Äôll be better later‚Äù but will it? Even in person, I‚Äôm betting classes are still gonna be kicking my ass. It seems like class work is all that there ever will be, with maybe a party or a night out on the town interspersed every so often.
comment,New Student,positive,Well in-person, I've found that the main differences are a: you can go to different places on campus to study/work + work with friends (so you can chill with people in the library or in some dorm or building and get coffee or snacks in between), which usually makes the work seem better a lot of the time. and b: in-person clubs and events. Big difference to virtual stuff, since you actually get to meet people, do activities in person, etc etc.  Both of these things, combined with occasional partying (which can be every week if you want it to), will make a huge difference. But yes, it's always going to be a lot of work, a fair amount of stress, and racing to meet deadlines. It can be net positive though.
comment,New Student,positive,No matter what if you are in a difficult major (like engineering) the "college experience" at a university like Michigan is going to be mostly related to work. That is to say that between classes, clubs, research, job search, etc. you will frequently be working the majority of the day and half of the night .  However, while you will be working quite hard, the friends you make during this time, whom you can both do work and hang out with are what really define your college experience. College is basically putting similarly intelligent people in close contact with each other to make connections for life, both professionally and personally. And unfortunately due to Covid it has been difficult this year to do so, so the majority of the "college experience" of this year has been quite a let down for all of us. Hopefully next year is better.
comment,New Student,neutral,I've just transferred to Michigan and I can absolutely relate to this. My days are exactly the same and I've been having the exact same thoughts.
comment,New Student,negative,Of course classes are still hard but don‚Äôt underestimate how much more fun it is to get your ass kicked with friends than getting your ass kicked alone
comment,New Student,positive,All nighters in the ugli, 2 am coffee breaks with friends, themed coop and club and frat parties with your friends where you have to dress up like aliens or surfers or porn stars, football tailgates where you‚Äôre wasted by noon, pancheros at 2 am when everyone‚Äôs trying to sober up, catching up with friends at the myriad of coffee shops on campus to study, having to book it to make it from one side of campus to another in 10 minutes, having your phone go off in a silent auditorium of 200 people, quick lunch at the league or the union before rushing off to your next club meeting, flirting with the person you sit next to in your lectures, being on campus from 10 am to 10 pm bc of club meetings and classes and loving every second of it. I miss it, so, so much. Classes can suck, but the rest of the umich experience makes it so worth it, in my opinion
comment,New Student,positive,I'm in my 10th semester here and I've never felt this way before UNTIL this semester. Even when you had literally no time to do anything, somehow there were a million spectacular moments in one day before COVID happened that made this experience worth doing.   I for one really miss all the times where I got to drop in on my friends at the Dude, chat with the teacher, attend a meeting, let alone all the big things like parties and celebrations and big game days. Even though those days were such a time drain, they only motivated me to work harder during the hours that I didn't sacrifice for pleasure. It was this weirdly torturous cycle, but now I understand and respect people who live for the grind. It's like you never really appreciate your time if you don't feel like you've earned it.  It's just really hard for everyone because we don't get that sense of accomplishment anymore, and I don't have any motivation to do my work. It feels like there's never enough time in the day to take care of what you need to, then do something worthwhile, before you have to go to sleep and do it all over again. But I promise you, it was so worth it to be here before COVID, and it will be once again.
comment,New Student,positive,I used to visit or go out with friends a lot of nights, just grabbing a bite to eat or playing video games or whatever. The period currently occupying "chill for the night" is where you can swap in more entertaining activities after the pandemic passes. Some classes do kick your ass all term, but especially freshman year, you should still have some free time if you're not working.
comment,New Student,positive,Classes definitely kicked my ass in person, but they generally didn't rob me of my will to get out of bed. Walking around downtown, spotting Reggie, grabbing a free pen and a donut from a student organization, making small talk with your deskmate, doing homework in the library, running into friends, using your student discount to see a play on a Friday night...all of that makes you feel human and makes the workload feel less crushing.   And, honestly, online classes are just harder. There's more busywork, and the exams are much harder to get through.
comment,New Student,positive,As an engineering alum I can say that 90% of college is gonna really suck. However, that other 10% is really really great. You're right that most of what you do will be classes, it's just how getting a degree from a prestigious university works. I honestly really hated most of my classes, but misery loves company, and you form some incredible bonds with people through your collective suffering. Being all online means you don't really get to meet all the people that make college more bearable through. Hopefully that'll change soon. Best of luck with everything and remember to take breaks from studying, your mental health will thank you
comment,New Student,positive,There really is no replacement for in person classes in college. I met so many friends just in my classes, and that simply cannot happen in a virtual environment. In engineering you will get your ass handed to you, but as many have said, in a normal semester you would be with your peers getting your asses handed to you together. Especially in such a collaborative field like engineering, face to face interaction is very important
comment,New Student,positive,Engineering undergrad and grad student here, from my experience it gets harder up until junior year, but eases off during senior year  Freshman year consisted of the least workload, but the most exams and the most be on exams  Sophomore year was a mix of freshman and junior year  Junior year was the year with the most workload and the hardest material  Senior year (without counting extra curriculars) was the easiest of my undergrad years  My SUGS year is the easiest of all the years by far  Everything everyone else is saying about working with friends or the "two am coffee breaks" is completely true, being able to do hw in a group is a lot more fun than doing it alone
comment,New Student,negative,That‚Äôs what college is. You‚Äôre here to study and graduate on time. In person classes are still going to kick your ass but at least you can get your ass kicked with your friends in class
comment,New Student,positive,Here's what I've found personally - During school, it feels like almost all of your time is spent doing work, with only a little bit of fun once in a while, but when it's all over those good times will be really memorable and as a whole you look back on it fondly.

comment,New Student,positive,I find it a lot easier to manage work when I have a life outside of it!
comment,New Student,positive,Sadly, I cannot tell you what the college experience is like because I was a working student. However, I think that the "experience" is finding what you love to study, studying that, and trying your best at what you are working towards. It doesn't mean that you won't struggle but, from my experience in college, I loved what I did.   The feeling is unreal when you receive your diploma so keep working hard and never give up!

comment,New Student,positive,I'm getting my grad degree in mechanical engineering online through UM and my school life is about as involved as when I got my undergrad at the University of Idaho.  I was there to get a degree so it was class, work, homework/study, drink with my two roommates, do it all over again. Now I exercise instead of drink, but from my perspective there's very little difference between in person and online for me. Depends on what you're in school for.  Obvously if you're there for the social experience you're gonna miss out.   But as someone who's been in the industry since 2011 and has a drive to continue learning and developing new tools, I'll recommend you study your math classes extra hard and just get through it.  On the other hand, there's no issue with you reaching out to your online classmates and putting together a study group and a social drinking hour over zoom.
comment,New Student,positive,If you dont join a club or have an extensive network of friends, that will be your indefinite experience. But not all clubs, just the non social ones
comment,New Student,negative,No I mean college is total garbage and a scam so you're right
comment,New Student,neutral,I think you're an engineering student and not an engineer. Engineer would imply that someone is paying you to do work.
post,Degree,positive,Hello! I am currently a freshman taking EECS 280 and I want to pursue a degree in CS. However, I have not taken EECS 203 yet. I was planning to take it in the fall, but then I could not take EECS 281 until next winter, which worries me since there would be a large gap between my two coding classes. Would it be worth it to take 203 over the summer, or will the amount of time be fine? thanks :)
comment,Degree,positive,If you can take it over the summer i would because not only will it let you take 281 faster, but you will be able to space out your upper levels as well. Additionally, for that reason i would consider taking 370 at the same time as 281. You shouldn‚Äôt do anything else super difficult that semester then. Its ok to not take it too, but 281 will be a little harder but you never really forget coding itll just take a little extra looking up / looking back at projects so make sure to save ur code
comment,Degree,negative,I took 280 and 203 winter freshman year and 281 fall of sophomore year. There is still around 4 months of time off for summer break so you‚Äôre going to lose some of your coding knowledge anyways, but I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about it once you start 281 you do so much coding that you‚Äôll get back into the swing of things, doing it on the winter is fine. I know lots of people who have done the same
comment,Degree,positive,I was in your same exact boat for my sophomore year. I took 183 and 280 during my freshman year, and then took 203 during the fall of my sophomore year which meant there was almost a one year gap between 280 and 281.   Honestly, it does take some time getting used to it again after such a large break, but as the other  commenter said, you do so much coding that you‚Äôll get the hang of it pretty quickly again. I wouldn‚Äôt worry so much about it, you‚Äôll most likely be fine. And if you want to, you can do some personal projects during the summer with C++ and that will help a bit. But overall, I took 203 during the fall of my sophomore year and 281 the winter after that and it was fine. I struggled a lot with 203 so I can imagine that doing it over half a semester should be even more challenging.   If I were you, I‚Äôd spend the summer doing personal projects/leetcode if that‚Äôs your thing and enjoy Ann Arbor during the summer, because you might not get many opportunities to do so when you start getting internships and then graduate.
comment,Degree,positive,I took 280 the winter my freshman year, 203 the fall of my sophomore year, and then 281 and 376 the winter of my sophomore year, with no summer coding and I didn‚Äôt feel a gap in coding at all in between. I felt that 281 did a good job of review and making sure you knew what you needed to succeed in the projects/exams.
comment,Degree,positive,although it‚Äôs more of a crunch and it might be vastly different/harder/poorly run virtually, if you‚Äôre someone who might get bored over the summer or don‚Äôt have anything set in stone taking 203 over the spring might be useful. i did that, and although it was pretty grueling I was able to focus on it more bc it was my only class and I got a good grade and I was able to take 281 first semester sophomore year which I guess gave me more time to do more upper levels. of course it‚Äôs still dependent though on how u personally work/want to spend the summer

post,Housing,positive,The housing rates are very high, is it better to live in an apartment off campus? Do you have any suggestions?
comment,Housing,neutral,NIMBYs
comment,Housing,negative,Primarily because 1) long-term Ann Arbor citizens do not want tall buildings (and thus refuse to zone accordingly) and 2) UM inhales any newly empty land in the area (and even buys up land that isn't empty yet), thus removing it from the property tax pool which raises the initial costs of development so high that no one is willing to enter the market.  Other minor contributors include Ann Arbor City Council's endless stream of requirements for building, some necessary, others not, that discourage all but the largest, most well-funded builders from proposing plans and navigating the site approval process through the City.
comment,Housing,positive,The "why" is largely an issue of supply and demand. The university student population grows faster than university housing capacity does. There are also real costs building/maintaining university housing and providing amenities and services within them, but I think dorm fees are calibrated to some extent to limit demand.  Off campus housing faces a similar issue; a continually growing city with little room for expansion (the main part of the city is bounded by expressways and a self-imposed greenway). Most housing growth is through replacing lower density residences with higher density residences, like the high-rises sprouting up on South University Ave. Off campus housing costs are also elevated by relatively high property taxes, which fund programs favored by the city's relatively liberal voters.  For an incoming freshman, it depends on the individual, but I'd generally recommend on-campus housing if you're able to afford it, as it's a good way to make friends with other people new to campus. It can also be a good bridge between leaving home for the first time and living on your own; Resident Advisors and other dorm staff can help smooth the transition as you adjust to a different environment.
comment,Housing,neutral,$1500 for a place with pink bathroom tiles still üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇ Ann Arbor
comment,Housing,negative,A lot of it has been said before, but I'll condense it to a few points that I believe are the main reasons:  1. NIMBYism is rampant.  It is so tough to build new housing units. 2. The University buys up so much property, and takes it out of the property tax pool, because it is tax exempt.  This results in the City having to levy much higher property taxes on everyone else to raise similar or higher levels of revenue. 3. A lot of the off-campus student housing is owned by a few large landlords. 4. Tenant protections in Ann Arbor are weak as fuck, for being such a tenant-heavy city. 5. It is hard to vote out NIMBYs  and pro-landlord reps 6. in the City Council if elections happen in the summer (when most students are away and won't vote). 7. Building new  on-campus student housing has not been a priority for the  University.  What's the result?  A lot of you apparently pay more for rent in a college town that you would in America's Second City, Chicago:  [2021 Compare Cities Housing: Ann Arbor, MI vs Chicago, IL (bestplaces.net)](https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/ann_arbor_mi/chicago_il/housing)
comment,Housing,neutral,ICC coops are an option. Not for everyone though.
comment,Housing,negative,Ann Arbor's housing market is just one giant scam I hate it so much. To live here is a pain in the ass. Landlords and property managers know that students will come every year no matter what and because of this (and other factors), they have basically ZERO incentive to modernize or do proper upkeep of their properties. Trust me, I have been all over Ann Arbor looking for housing and I toured countless shitty apartments that go for ridiculous prices. The apartments or houses that do have newer appliances or have been renovated are also ridiculously expensive.  Off campus apartments are a real bargain compared to what you find in Ann Arbor. I highly recommend it. I think it's way better to live off campus but that really depends on the person. I'm currently living about a 50 minute walk from campus, but less than 20 minute bike ride. The rent is cheap and I get a lot of amenities you won't find in an apartment on campus (in-unit washer/dryer, free parking, all or most utilities included, etc) for the price.
comment,Housing,positive,yea honestly looking back i paid way too much for apartments and honestly none of them are worth it compared to other cities i‚Äôve lived, i stayed in varsity, the hub and zaragon east, i paid approximately ($1500-$2000) a month in rent during my time in michigan. none were worth it but again the other options weren‚Äôt any better it‚Äôs an issue that really needs to be addressed
comment,Housing,positive,If you're looking at off campus apartments, it's probably best to look at the areas surrounding Ann Arbor as anything within AA is still going to have an inflated price. As such, I would only recommend apartments in AA if they're within walking distance of campus because of the convenience.  Other from apartments, co-ops are an option for cheaper housing near campus with a time/work commitment tacked on. No idea what state they're in with COVID still around, however.
comment,Housing,positive,Off campus apartments are more expensive. The best way to save housing expenses is living with an elder homeowner near campus. In exchange for free home made healthy food, you need to help the owner remove trash, mow the lawn ...
comment,Housing,negative,Dorms are expensive at nearly every college. Ann Arbor has a particularly bad housing demand problem though. At most other state schools, moving off campus slashes your housing cost in half, at Michigan if you save any money you‚Äôre saving a few hundred bucks.
post,Housing,positive,I'm wondering when is the latest that I can get off-campus housing for 2021-2022. I'm hoping to live in the dorms again but Housing told me it's not guaranteed, and they don't even have a timeline yet to apply for 2021-2022. When is the latest I can get an apartment at say Courtyards or a room at a co-op? Thanks.
comment,Housing,positive,Courtyards typically has openings all the time. Especially if you‚Äôre willing to live in a unit with roommates they pick for you. No rush there.   The more desirable co-ops fill up, but even that seems to have been slowed by COVID. I went on their website and saw open rooms at MichMinnie‚Äôs, which seems odd compared to normal years. I think you could get a spot at some of the larger or less popular places (Truth, Gregory, North Campus) into the summer.
post,New Student,neutral,I‚Äôm an incoming freshman at u of m and I want to visit the campus this spring. I know there‚Äôs no in person campus tour right now, but is it possible to just walk around the campus without entering any building?
comment,New Student,neutral,Im not sure how much you will enjoy this visit as campus is VERY dead right now. But if you are in the area it can‚Äôt hurt as some buildings do look nice
comment,New Student,positive,If you come on a weekend with decent weather you'll get a good feel for the campus for sure.
comment,New Student,positive,Despite what the other comment says, there has recently been quite a bit of activity on AA because of the warm weather. I recommend just hanging out around diag and state street, maybe get lunch or bubble tea. Things are much quieter than normal, but you will still get the campus vibe if you walk around a bit (I also recommend visiting palmer field if it is a nice day because you‚Äôll be kids studying and playing basketball, and it‚Äôs just a nice, calm college-y area)
comment,New Student,positive,yep
post,Housing,negative,michigan housing makes me genuinely want to drop out of this school. i hate it so much and why is everything so far away like if i live in my sorority house i‚Äôll be a 20+ minute walk from the union/state street and do i even wanna live there??? probably not tbh but signing a year long apartment lease is so stressful and they‚Äôre so expensive too. anyway. just felt like ranting bc idk what i‚Äôm doing and i have insane anxiety about housing right now :(
comment,Housing,positive,If it helps at all, the housing companies always try to make housing seem like it‚Äôs gonna run out but in reality it NEVER does. They want you to sign quickly. If you wait till the summer or even early fall, there are much better deals on leases and even some good sublease options through other students. I‚Äôve been doing this. Worst case I don‚Äôt get housing quick enough and I pay a friend to live with them for a few weeks
comment,Housing,negative,Sorry you're stressed out op. It will be okay!

comment,Housing,positive,I feel ya, I‚Äôm still trying to reconcile an hour long drive one way on top of however long it‚Äôll take me to get to central campus from an orange lot next semester/year.
comment,Housing,positive,Look around at some of the smaller apartment complexes. There are a bunch by Hill street that are really nice and are not too expensive if you get a roommate. I love my apartment. Its really big, has parking, two bathrooms and has all new kitchen and bath and tbh the price is really reasonable (less then 900 a month). You just have to look around and avoid the high rise apartments. they are over-priced and small. I hope this helps

comment,News,positive,I don‚Äôt understand why the authors seem to find it concerning that 1/10th of the students at Michigan come from public high schools in the metro Detroit area.  Then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúNinety-four of the 301 top schools were within Michigan, meaning most, if not all, of those students pay in-state tuition. Despite being only one-third of schools on The Daily's list of 301 schools, these 94 schools contain more than 57% of the admitted students and about 68% of the enrolled students.‚Äù   I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs surprising that more students from the state of Michigan apply to Michigan, are accepted, and attend. And why does this seem like a problem? It‚Äôs a public college located in southeast Michigan that gets students primarily from southeast Michigan and the rest of the state; this isn‚Äôt a feeder-school situation.   What warrants the remark about most students paying in-state tuition?   What were they expecting?  EDIT: It's unclear throughout the article whether they think that  1. More out-of-state students should be admitted, and in-state students should pay the same tuition;  2. Too many out-of-state students are admitted and create a feeder-school situation that discriminates against Michigan HS graduates from underperforming districts.  It seems like they try to argue both points somehow.

comment,News,positive,"Though still often criticized as a rich, elite university, more than 22% of new in-state undergraduates in 2019 came from families with incomes under $65,000."  Why is this a "though"? The median family income in this country is only slightly higher than that, which means that if the school weren't skewing quite wealthy, more like HALF of students would come from families with incomes like this.  That the authors frame 65k as if it's a low family income is, ironically, indicative of the very problem it purports to critique.

post,Housing,positive,Hi guys, What does ‚Äúsingle in 3 person suite,‚Äù what does that mean?  EDIT: I really didn‚Äôt have information about housing at allüòï. Despite all the downvotes, I learned a lot and I really appreciate your advise and helpü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è.
comment,Housing,positive,If you‚Äôre an incoming freshman you don‚Äôt really get to pick your room type on that granular a level. And most freshmen end up in traditional doubles with shared hall bathrooms.
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôm pretty sure this means you‚Äôll share a common living space with two other people but have your own sleeping room.  Edit: if you‚Äôre a freshman requesting this type of room you‚Äôll probably end up in Baits.  Living on North as a freshman sucks, even if you‚Äôre in engineering.  You‚Äôll probably only have 1-2 classes on North a semester.  Living on North only makes sense if you‚Äôre an upperclassman and all your classes are on North, but even then the North campus dorms have terrible infrastructure and it‚Äôs a lot harder to have a social life.
comment,Housing,positive,I lived in a single in 3-person suite my freshman year in Baits II. It was a 8ft-by-10ft room all for myself, connected to a common room with a couch and coffee table. The common room was connected to a double (so I had two suitemates) and our own bathroom.  Also, idk why some people are downvoting you for wanting to live in those type of arrangements. You‚Äôre genuinely curious, and you probably don‚Äôt know too much about the locations of dorms. Some people just have a vendetta about North Campus.
comment,Housing,neutral,Even as an engineering student, you‚Äôll likely only have one or two classes on North campus and the others will be on central. This means you‚Äôll probably have to take a bus daily and the buses can be somewhat unreliable at times. Plus, being on north campus, for some, can make it harder to develop a social life mainly because you are isolated a little bit. It‚Äôs different for everyone but as a freshman, it might be better to chose a general, double or single dorm type because your more likely to be placed on central. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be guaranteed a place on central just more likely to have one. You‚Äôll get a lot more information about this during the summer and the application for it hasn‚Äôt even opened yet. The prices have not been announced yet either and the dorm type that you‚Äôd describe is usually one of the more expensive ones.

post,Class,negative,I am planning on majoring in cs and I was taking EECS 281 this semester. However, my mental health has been seriously suffering these past few months and so I dropped the class a while ago. My mental health also started to affect me in end of last semester in EECS 280, to the point where on the first exam I scored in the 90s and on the final exam I was in the 70s. This made 281 immediately overwhelming because a lot of the topics at the end of 280 are used in 281. I‚Äôve been struggling with imposter syndrome and questioning whether or not I am actually smart enough to be a cs major because in 281 I felt like I just had no idea what I was going and it made me seriously doubt myself. I dropped the class to help my mental health but instead I‚Äôm finding myself dreading the class and also beating myself up for dropping it in the first place and failing to learn the content well enough in 280.   So now I‚Äôm trying to decide if I should take 281 in the spring semester or just wait to take it next fall. If I take it in the spring then I would be ready for fall internships, but I am also very intimidated by the shortened semester and heavier workload and I don‚Äôt know if I can do it. I have actually been having nightmares about the class it‚Äôs been stressing me out so much.   So, does anyone have any experiences or advice about EECS 281 in the spring? Ways to prepare for 281? How to combat imposter syndrome and self doubt? Also, if I do end up taking 281 in the fall, do I still have a chance at getting an internship?
comment,Class,positive,281 in spring is probably the move. Even though it‚Äôs in a shorter period, it‚Äôs generally less overwhelming because you only have to worry about that class and not 3-4 like in a normal semester. Definitely review topics from 203 and 280 before spring because you‚Äôll need to be very comfortable with C++ if you want to do well on projects. Also, definitely utilize office hours when you‚Äôre stuck. If you like CS in general and enjoy coding, then don‚Äôt stress too much over grades. A 90 on a midterm and 70 on a final in 280 is nothing to be concerned with.
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm doing a CS minor, not major  Fwiw I got a 70 on the 280 midterm, a 90 on the 280 final, and I ended up getting a flat B in 281.  If you‚Äôre getting above average or even above 1 stdev on 280 exams you‚Äôre fine.  If 281 is the only class you‚Äôre taking in the spring semester the workload will be fine.    But in the end, it‚Äôs only a class.  If CS doesn‚Äôt turn out to be your thing that‚Äôs fine. No one can be good at everything. You still have time to look at other majors.  This isn‚Äôt something you should be having nightmares over and it sounds like you should talk to someone about your mental health situation (don‚Äôt bother with caps they‚Äôre worthless).  Don‚Äôt let your entire identity and sense of self get wrapped up in how good you are at one particular field.  As far as getting an internship, the only thing that really matters is if you can solve the programming challenges.  Doing leetcode practice problems is a great way to prepare for interviews and 281.

post,Class,positive,Hi, I'm a biomolecular sciences major and I need to choose one of the above courses. What are their main differences and what are your experiences with them? Thanks!
comment,Class,positive,From what I have heard, CHEM230 stayed hard af during the pandemic, while CHEM260 got a lot easier (no exams, just quizzes). During a normal semester, I would just choose which one aligns more with your goals: CHEM230 to fulfill med school requirements and know the basics of P Chem (I'm a big fan of this professor, she's very kind) and CHEM260 for more heavy-duty biochem majors. If you don't like P chem, stick with 230, but if you enjoy the topic, do 260.
comment,Class,negative,I‚Äôm a GSI who has taught both Chem 230/260  On paper the main difference is Chem 260 is calculus based and teaches quantum mechanics, whereas Chem 230 requires only algebra and skips quantum. If you‚Äôre a pre-med student and are not taking any additional chem classes I‚Äôd go with Chem 230, if you‚Äôre a chem major I‚Äôd do Chem 260.   Chem 230 is taught as a flipped classroom, so you watch lectures at home and during lecture time you solve problems together. There‚Äôs no homework, but doing the exam prep problems (20+ pages each exam) is basically required. Chem 260 in the past has been a traditional course with weekly problem sets, but this semester the format is flipped and weekly quizzes instead of exams.
comment,Class,neutral,Chem 260 requires a physics pre-requisite while Chem 230 does not.

comment,Class,positive,First of all, I wish you the best of luck with this class! I took 492 last semester with Professor Emily Mower Provost, and if I remember correctly, she said that there is no curve in this class. Average on the midterm was a low 80 (mean of 82.07 and median of 83 with a standard deviation of 7.86). One thing that really helped me was posting on the ‚ÄúSearch for Teammates‚Äù part of piazza to find a group of people to have occasional zoom calls with and go over general concepts for homework/exams. Best of luck!
post,Class,neutral,so Im in EECS 183 but dropping it for a variety of reasons, mostly academic as I'd prefer focusing on Econ 401 and 251 this semester which have been tough for me. As a result, I have barely studied for the midterm (Why would I if I dropped it)  Only problem is I'm still technically in the class because the school hasn't accepted my drop request. I just wanna make sure they always accept these requests if you're still full time before I proceed to not take the midterm in \~2 hours.   (Also yes I know they tell you to still go to your classes but I have a midterm tomorrow and it'd be really silly to waste time taking a midterm for a class Im not taking at this point)
comment,Class,positive,Do you know where in the process it is? I *think* you can check that on Wolverine Access. If it hasn't been approved by the faculty member yet it is likely because the email notice about it got buried in their inbox. Definitely feel free to send them a heads up about that.   Speaking from my own experience (acknowledging this is with grad students, not UG), I have never rejected one of these except in cases where it would jeopardize legal status of an international student. My guess is that somebody missed an email along the approver chain.
comment,Class,negative,Maybe try emailing your advisor again? They‚Äôre normally the ones who do the drop requests, and might just be waiting on a confirmation from you.
comment,Class,positive,Email the instructor in addition to your advisor if you haven‚Äôt already. They have to approve it, too, and those emails can get buried especially around midterms.   Generally instructors don‚Äôt make a big deal about it and just approve it, but be sure to meet with an advisor to make sure you‚Äôre still on track if this was a class for your major/minor/gen credits.

post,Prospective Student,negative,I see for Ross a first year calc class is required, but what that means is confusing. If I score a 5 on AP Calc AB, Do i need to take a calc class at all for Ross (considering i get credit for Calc I then), or would it just push me into Calc 2 and then I'd have to take that instead. I'm reading conficting things so idk. I'm trying to avoid these supposed "killer math" classes at UofM and I'm not really fond of Math, especially Calc.

post,COVID-19,positive,Hey y'all, proud umich alum here. I can't believe it's been five years since I graduated, but here we are. Now we're more than a year into a global pandemic that's killed enough Americans to fill the Big House *five times.* I don't need to rehash how unimaginable this loss is in all of our communities, all while seeing rapid periods of social justice change, political strife, missteps by University administration, and other world-changing events.  I can't lie, this subreddit is really tough to read through some days. The varied accounts of lack of motivation, difficulty keeping up, that silly 'wellness day,' and endless work. I cannot imagine having to take classes and keep up right now. The Michigan curriculum is pressing enough as it is, but bearing the burden of the last year has surely amplified this.   I wish I could give advice. I wish I could tell you to just suck it up and power through for a few more months. But I can't. I haven't been there. I haven't had to stay on top of classes during a pandemic. I haven't needed to attend Zoom classes all day. I haven't had to balance online class with online homework and online papers and online office hours and online *everything*. Just typing that sounds exhausting.  But I am here to tell you: **your feelings are valid.** I cannot imagine any of this. In fact, I don't think anyone outside of your position can. What you're working through is nothing short of miraculous. Please take time to recognize this. You have every right to be stressed, weakened, emptied, unmotivated, frustrated or anything else you're feeling.   College is supposed to be the 'best years of your life.' Maybe it already has been for you. If not, I really truly hope that y'all are able to find this out first-hand soon. Michigan is a wonderful place with many wonderful people, and though I haven't been away for too long, I find myself longing for Ann Arbor throughout every day. Take time to realize what you're going through - the good and the bad. Let me know if you ever wanna chat. Your fellow wolverines are rooting hard for y'all, I promise.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I think college becomes the "best years of our lives" as we get older and look back on college life, especially when compared to our (eventual) actual adult lives, which I'm sure has its own range of pain-in-the-neck problems.

When I was in campus I was so stressed and depressed all the time.( I had TMJ from being overly stressful that hasn't recovered to this day lol.) I hated every second of it and couldn't wait to get out of school, be a real adult and never look back. (I dropped the thought of getting a master's because F**K THAT)  I like my work, my team and my company. But do I enjoy working as much as I imagined before I graduated? ....All I can say is I missed my time in campus. The classrooms are just much simpler and less non sense. I missed it. A lot. So guess who's applying for a master program now lol. .. I just wanted to relive the time one last time. (Very likely I'll go through the FK THIS BS again but oh well lol )

post,Health / Wellness,positive,Hey Wolverines!  I spent too much time watching Youtube this year. So I made a chrome extension to constantly remember goals for 2021 before I type youtube.com into my browser.  This is year has been a bit bittersweet for me. Since I realized 2021 is going to be another whole year of Zoom University, everything became unproductive. I was a bit lost in my life.  My solution was regularly reminding my goals! Every morning, I read my goals out loud for 2021 and spent a few minutes checking the progress. This little practice really helped me a lot. It was a small thing but really made me stay motivated for the whole day.  As I graduate this summer, I want to finish strong and also meaningful. So my friend and I created this Chrome Extension! Yes, there are tons of extensions for new tab productivity but I wanted something simple and clean. Crazyones Tab features inspiring quotes from great entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates! Plus whenever you open a new tab, you'll be able to see new quotes as well as your goals for 2021. We designed the extension to become a source of motivation + to stay on top of your goals for 2021.  My friend and I started building this Chrome Extension as a side project and now it became the most meaningful and memorable part of my college experience. It's not perfect but I hope this helps to boost people's productivity and stop watching YouTube :)  You can find the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crazyones-new-tab/noacokcfnplaajfaajhfcnmniehoddcd  Thanks!
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I‚Äôm planning to take chem 125/126/130 this spring at some other college where the class would be easier and of lesser cost. When I looked up at WCC, I‚Äôll have to take 2 classes worth 8 credits to fulfil the equivalency, i.e. more workload than required . Any recommendation on where I can take this class for 5 credits?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,At UMich, 125 + 130 is 5 credits total I believe.
post,Class,negative,A friend of mine took EECs 183 last semester, and I am taking EEC's right now. After I submitted my most recent project (I did not cheat, or share anything/look up anything) I compared my code to hers. And it was very very similar. I just do not get how the plagiarism detection system that EECS department uses detects cheating. EECS 183 is a intro class with minimal solutions to the test cases. There are not many different ways to write the code from someone else. But I noticed one or more of my functions is almost exactly the same except for a different variable. But she did not show me anything when I was working on it because she knew the consequences of a Honor Code Violation. But now I am scared that I will be violated for doing nothing wrong, except writing my own code that is perhaps similar to hers. Is this just how it is for EECS 183? Are the teachers more lenient on the Honor Code Violation for the first 2 projects. The project literally tells you exactly what to do, there is not much room for creativity. Also, I tried looking up cases of EECs 183 violations and I can not find many. Is this the reason why? I can only find Honor Code violations for EECS 280 and above. Anyways, I saw that I will get -1/3 of a letter grade and a 0 on the assignment. And I heard it is a long process to fight it. What can I do?? I am definitely going to fight it if I get accused because I am innocent, but I do not feel like taking all the time to do so. This is annoying. If whatever, detection system they use actually flags my code, then it must flag 100 others because that makes no sense. Literally....literally for some functions there is a simple way to do it, then there is a complex way. And I am sure many people choose the simple way. And for a intro course like this, there has to be a huge overlap in similar code. Right? I am sorry for ranting, you can downvote this, but I am just upset, because I just compared my code with hers and saw all the similarities. And I am currently am having a freakout and can't go to bed. Also, if my parents ever found out that I got a violation for cheating. I would actually not be alive. Please answer with anything- it can be EECS 183 violations you heard of, or how strict the EECS 183 instructors are on similarity for the first two projects, or anything!!! Thank you guys so much. ps. I need to go to bed now, I have been freaking out about this violation stuff for 4 hours now.
comment,Class,positive,A lot of low level and simple functions will look pretty much identical between students.  That‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre looking for with honor code violations.  They‚Äôre more interested in large scale structural and organizational similarities which are much less likely to occur by coincidence.  These are detected automatically by the autograder and manually reviewed by the staff.
comment,Class,positive,broski if you didnt copy, why u stressing? Sounds like you might've copied.
comment,Class,positive,bro calm down, if you didn't cheat you'll be 100% fine.    For intro classes like EECS 183 and sometimes 280 if the project/function is basic enough that there's only so many ways to do it, they know that there's going to be a lot overlap in the implementation. As long as you didn't do something dumb like submit the exact same file or copy and paste a comment with someone else's name, you should be ok. Even if they think you cheated, you could probably explain yourself to the honor council if you really didn't cheat and unless they have decisive evidence on the contrary, you will be fine.
comment,Class,positive,Before I say anything let me make it clear that you're screwing yourself if you cheat in EECS. If you get away with it, congrats ig, but you're fucked for the exams.  If you're interested in how the autograder plagiarism detector actually works, its a combination of MOSS flagging and manual checking.   you can read more about moss here: https://yangdanny97.github.io/blog/2019/05/03/MOSS https://github.com/genchang1234/How-to-cheat-in-computer-science-101  But yeh, lots of code looks similar, especially in 183, 280, and 281, a lot of projects will end up looking similar because there's really only a couple of efficient ways to do them (especially if the project has a very detailed spec that literally tells you what to do). However, moss will split your code into unique hashes and compare it with a database of stored hashes from previous semester's code and online databases (i.e code you can copy from google). Every time you submit to autograder it will be run with MOSS.   Splitting code into hashes essentially negates a lot of low level cheating obfuscation like variable renaming, structure reordering, spaghetti-fing and ect. If enough similarity is detected, your code gets flagged for a grader to check over and compare. I'm guessing that for super simple functions that only have 1 way to code (i.e a majority of 183), MOSS won't even look at similar function hashes and instead take your overall program style and compare it with others. An actual human being will look over your code if you get flagged. Since they're usually Profs or experienced graders, they will know if you cheated or not, and pass it on to the honor council if you did.   If you did cheat, good luck with that. If you didn't, you have literally nothing to worry about.
comment,Class,negative,If you didn't cheat, you're fine.  For simple functions like the ones you're talking about, the professors will be reasonable. They won't flag you for cheating if there's only one or two ways to do something. The cheating detection system might flag you, but no one gets reported to the Honor Council without a staff member manually looking over the assignment to use their personal judgement.    More people are flagged in 280 and 281 because there's more freedom, so cheating is much more obvious.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,This is less of a rant and more of just an observation, I guess.   I'm sure nearly everyone feels the same way, but just when I think I've burned out, there's just more and more burnout that follows. All my classes are synchronous and it's gotten to a point where my first thought every morning when I wake up is "I hate X class so much." I can tell that most people probably feel burned out, as class averages on quizzes in many of my classes are solidly in the 50%'s (as are mine lmao).  I've been able to focus for the past 1.5 sems on zoom (including Spring), but recently it's just gotten to the point where no matter how hard I try, I cannot bring myself to pay attention in some classes. Has anyone encountered this and successfully combatted it? I'd appreciate any tips at all
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I started rewarding myself for getting through a lecture with either a 30 min episode of something on Netflix or like a quick nap. I don‚Äôt know haha
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I feel like my case might be too specific but I saw a psychiatrist to help with my focus. I'll elaborate if anyone is interested.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Meditation has really helped me preserve mental energy throughout the day which in turn helps with my focus. The new Headspace Guide to Meditation show on Netflix is honestly not a bad way to get started. It might seem counter-intuitive to spend *more* time away from work to improve productivity, but it's helped me stay productive when I need to and also fall asleep quicker. Just my 2¬¢.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Never before have I been able to put away all distractions and still just spend fifteen minutes blankly staring at a lecture slide
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I'm not in school anymore, but I feel the same way about my job and I graduated last year, so I spent a semester in Zoom U. Finding ways to create routine and scheduled breaks in the day has been really helpful to me. And it's not routine like, "at nine thirty on the dot, I make breakfast and coffee". It's routine in the sense of physically moving out of my home space to go do things not related to my home activities. So four days a week, I go to the gym, and once a week, usually on the day I don't work out, I go to a bookstore and wander about aimlessly for an hour or so. The breaks give me time and space to separate myself from the daily grind and keep me physically active--which like "exercising is good for your mental health!" is such a cliche, but it's honestly key to my continued function. But gyms are related to your personal covid situation and risk tolerance, so YMMV.   Moving outside my home environment also allows and encourages the maintenance of weak ties, so people you see in your daily routine but wouldn't consider friends--your favorite barista, your class friend you never speak to again once the semester ends. In my case, my favorite B&N cashier and the women who also attend my gym. People put a lot of emphasis on close friendships, but there's some research suggesting weak ties are just as helpful, both for mental health and for the things you need networks for, like jobs when you graduate.   [Zoom fatigue is real](https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/1), so turn off the camera and minimize the screen whenever possible. Another thing that helps me deal with this is playing games with low cognitive loads in the background, stuff like minecraft and valheim. I can listen (not quite as well, but well enough) and my hands are occupied, which allows me to move past my natural urge to fidget and scroll while also bypassing zoom fatigue.  Also, some days it just isn't gonna happen, and that's okay. Let it not happen. Forcing it is only gonna frustrate you, and then you'll be less productive and have more days where it isn't gonna happen. Be kind to yourself and take time where you need it. Find little ways to trigger resets if you really need to get shit done. Your brain can be a bit like a computer, and sometimes that means you need to turn it off and back on again. The gym is one of mine. So is Attack on Titan, and reading, and driving.   What you're feeling is normal now. It's shitty and unfortunate and that's not very helpful to hear, but it's normal nonetheless. Be gentle with yourself, and this too shall pass.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,I feel so old seeing all these '24 flairs, anyways I know how you feel this is my 5th and final year at michigan (sugs year) and I cannot sit through an electronic lecture,  apart from the first week I have only watched recordings when I have to for homework  it doesn't help that one of my three classes is basically review and I don't have to worry about needing the material after college, so the motivation just isn't there for me  Edit: accidentally posted before finishing
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I'm an old UM grad, so haven't experienced that, but I don't envy you. I wonder if burnout like you're experiencing might be mitigated by treating each lecture as a separate case of temporary fatigue. Like look at tips from articles googling [https://www.google.com/search?q=**how+to+combat+zoom+fatigue**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+combat+zoom+fatigue), and just try to get through one lecture at a time.  I remember an after-lunch physics course in which I couldn't focus was when I first learned to use caffeine therapeutically, but if you aren't a freshman, you're probably already doing that.   I've also experienced driving fatigue, and while sometimes that just requires pulling over and resting, I do a few things for a temporary concentration boost:  * playing music with a good beat * dancing (even while seated), tapping feet and hands, etc. to increase your heart and respiration rates - even minor continual movement helps * opening a window for a somewhat uncomfortably cold breeze  I don't know if those would help you get through a lecture, but it might be worth exploring. Of course you'd want to adjust your audio mixer so you can still hear the class, and might want to Stop Video while you rock out on air guitar.  As much as I hated walking to classes in the winter, I wonder if the aerobic and chilling effects of those walks might have provided a natural concentration boost that you're now lacking.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Incoming freshman in the fall and I want to be comfortable with the language. I know Java and Swift but haven't grown comfortable with Python or C. Thanks.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Intro courses (your first 3) use C++, then you get some experience in C in Computer Architecture (which is a pretty easy transition). You'll use Python in a lot of your upper level courses because it's powerful and flexible. Don't be worried about a lack of experience in a language coming in - the whole degree you're paying for will teach you to program.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,C++
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you know Java you‚Äôll find the switch to C++ easy, and will probably like it more tbh
comment,Prospective Student,positive,All "main-sequence" classes here use C++. That's EECS 183, 280, and 281. EECS 183 also teaches some python. If you're in CoE rather than LSA, you'll be taking ENGR 101 or 151. In those classes, you learn C++ and Matlab.    If you know Java, it'll be a pretty easy switch to C++. It was for me, anyway.    EECS 370 uses C, but it should come pretty easy after 2+ semesters of C++.    Upper level classes are more varied. Lots of them still use C++, but some will use other things like python, JS, etc.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre in CoE or LSA, but the Engr 101 class that you take freshman year in CoE will teach you the basics of C++ and I learned a ton. There‚Äôs also Engr 151 that you can take instead of you have previous programming experience.
post,Prospective Student,positive,so i have not been accepted yet but i got an email saying i should apply for financial aid with the email title ‚Äúentering students and families‚Äù , does that mean i got in or am i looking to much into it. i just really want to go to this school so it makes sense if i‚Äôm looking to much into it lol.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I don‚Äôt remember if you get an email immediately when you are accepted or if you need to check your status on a separate website or portal somewhere. Maybe go double check to see? Wishing you good luck!!!
post,Research,positive,The website says that the decision will come out in early March, so I thought to create this post to start a conversation.
comment,Research,positive,If it helps, I participated in the SURE program last year, and received the official offer on March 9.
comment,Research,neutral,I have not heard anything yet
comment,Research,neutral,Heard nothing yet either
comment,Research,neutral,Get offer on March 15.
post,Class,negative,Can I still pass this class? Or is it a lost cause?
comment,Class,positive,got a 43 on the first midterm 62 on the second and 31 on the final and still passed ‚Äî homework saved my life. gotta focus up but it‚Äôs totally doable
comment,Class,negative,This class is curved to hell and back. You can definitely still pass.
comment,Class,positive,You can pass, but it won‚Äôt be easy. I got near the average and I‚Äôm still kind stressing out bc that‚Äôs C territory and you have to get a C to be CS.... so ig just put all ur effort into this class
comment,Class,negative,You can still pass. It‚Äôs hell but you can
comment,Class,positive,Same dude, 56 with less than half of the free response correct. Fml
comment,Class,negative,Definitely not a lost cause.  203's just a bitch.
comment,Class,negative,I did worse. I started the exam at 9pm local time cause I had a class conflict with the regular time. That sucked. Couldn't focus for shit. I went to my doctor and got some Xanax, so maybe I won't freak out next time. Anywho... I think March 1st was the last day to  get your tuition back, so that is sunk cost. You will get an internal W if you withdraw now up until April 21st. Might as well try as hard as you can and study for the next try. Worst case scenario, get a W and gotta take the class again. If you are headed for a C, then risk the final.
comment,Class,neutral,I got a 47% on the first midterm, 61% on 2nd and 44% on final and ended up getting a C- last semester/retaking this semester. I think it might be tough but if you can improve your next 2 scores to be in the 50-60% range at least you should be ok!!
comment,Class,positive,You can still make it. Get good scores on the homework and close to the mean on the next two exams. This is the hardest class you'll likely take at Michigan but thankfully the curve is great
post,Class,positive,203 exam scores just got posted and I got a 50%. I struggle weekly on the homeworks (about 60s% average), but I thought I felt confident about the exam after I took it. I invest so much of my time into trying to learn this class, but it just doesn't click. Scoring so low is a huge blow to my confidence and at this point it's starting to negatively affect the rest of my coursework (managing a 18 credit schedule). Can I even end up passing at this point? If I got a 50% on the first exam I cant imagine how hard the final will end up being. Appreciate any advice.
comment,Class,positive,Please add a department name to your post. It makes the sub more searchable.
comment,Class,positive,Honestly taking an 18 credit schedule with 203 might not have been the best decision, but if you can strike a balance that works for you then go for it. I think you definitely have a good chance to pass the class given this is only the first exam and you're in the high C range. I think the best thing to do if you decide to stick with it is identify what you could do better to study for the next one, which is basically my game plan rn lol. But also, depending on your year, you could always drop and take it again later when you have more room in your schedule. I think it's ultimately up to what works best for you, your mental health, and your schedule. If you decide to stick with it, you still have a chance, but if not, you probably have time to wait and take it again later on (I'm assuming). I also want to note that with homework, have you tried attending OH? I'm not sure how helpful it would be but in the interest of your grade, I think focusing on hw grades might be worthwile
comment,Class,positive,The lecture 13 slides says your score is about 1 standard deviation from the mean is about a C+. So as long as you show slight improvement you can pass with a C.
comment,Class,neutral,I've been getting 90% on my homeworks and I did worse than you on the midterm. My brain is old and slow, but thorough. I know my new strategy is to do a lot more exercises in the book to make my assessment of the questions and my strategic approach much more automatic. It's hard to imagine dedicating any more of my time to this class but I guess that's what I have to do. I do find the things I am learning in this class extremely valuable as I have applied its concepts in all my other classes.  I understand why is it essential to learning CS.
post,Class,positive,Do they only look at your most recent submission for style points? Or do they look at all your submissions. Also me and my friend did one function together on my first submission, just to see if it worked or not. But when I did my last submission I made sure to do my own function. Even though I submitted the function that my friend did first and resubmitted a totally different function at the end, will they see that. I just don‚Äôt want a honors code violation to see if the function worked or not and I didn‚Äôt even use it.
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm pretty sure any and all submissions are stored in the cheat checking database
comment,Class,positive,They will only check your most recent submission for style points.  However, you and your friend submitting the same code for any submission is playing with fire.  I would look at it this way: If I am sending them code that is the same as someone else's and they are storing it, there is definitely evidence that will link my submission to the other student's submission.  It's best not to do that at all.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I keep thinking of that meme someone posted here that said "i just have to get through this week" on a loop, and I feel like that and daydream about graduating so I can do something else besides spending the majority of my time on assignments and exams and constant catching-up. I think of all the hobbies I've barely touched since starting school and I feel like graduating will open up my schedule immensely. I don't rly relate to people saying they have the best time in college because i genuinely see it as solely job/work and the social aspects are also pretty nonexistent for me. the majority of the people i talk to are people i already knew from before college bc the friends i tried to make sort of faded into acquaintances. and the thought of having to find new friends over zoom is unappealing after i spend 8 hours at the computer anyways . and i don't think in-person school will help alleviate this feeling because i found it even more tiring and harder. anyways just wanted to get this out and was wondering if there are other people who feel the same way. idk if i feel this way because of COVID's upcoming 1 year anniversary or if it's like pre-senioritis or something.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I‚Äôm with you on that. 51 days until the last day of classes and then it‚Äôs just finals. Good riddance
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I‚Äôm only a freshman so I‚Äôve never had an in person college experience, everyone keeps telling me that I‚Äôll be happier when Covid ends, but I don‚Äôt really care because right now college sucks. It honestly does just feel like work, there are so many hobbies I‚Äôve put on hold and only spent a few hours on each semester, I don‚Äôt feel socially connected at all with the exception of a few people, most of whom I‚Äôve known since before college. You‚Äôre defiantly not alone
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Yeah college was total shit for me - having a job is way easier. IDK why schooling has to be hell for so many years just so you can finally get paid for your work after 21. blah
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,OMG FINALLY someone who understands me. You literally took all the thoughts out of my mind and wrote them up. Totally agree with you on college just being work and not having many oppts to interact (esp during covid) (I also only talk to my middle school friends). I've been sick and tired of college and the repetitiveness of it since sophomore year that I decided to graduate a year early (graduating this May; FKING FINALLY). I have so many things on my bucket list that I want to do when I graduate and can start focusing on things other than studying. We should totally grab a beer sometime after we graduate - I think we have a lot in common lolololol
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I keep thinking about that meme a lot too lol
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,School is meaningless. I don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with this place anymore.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,TLDR: at least read [this article](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/)  while as an alum I never encountered the COVID environment, I wanted to respond to the "can't wait to graduate" aspect." My freshmen and sophomore years were terrible. I had a few acquantances but had terrible FOMO and was sad all the time. By chance, my junior year,  I ended up in a house with someone who became one of my closest friends, and not just a roommate and my junior and senior years were significantly better. For the first two years I wanted to graduate and move on to "the real world."   But something happens when you leave Ann Arbor. you start to miss those acquaintances, where you just walk somewhere and see a familiar face on campus. I'd recommend reading this article called ["the opposite of loneliness."](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/) It helps put graduating college into perspective. I was lonely a lot in college, feeling very sad and wondering why i didn't have friends. It wasn't until I graduated though, that I realized that in college, there are lots of people like that. when you graduate, you lose that "community" and are so separate.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I‚Äôm a senior and I can‚Äôt wait to be done
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Hi everyone. I'll try to keep this mini rant short.   To current students, graduates, and beyond... how do you take control and initiative of your own life?  I have many personal interests, but I can't seem to grow in any of them (or at least, I'm not realizing it). I feel as if I idle a lot of the time... I feel like I'm not in control. A theory in high school was that I had ADD, which was probable according to meetings with a psychologist, but couldn't afford the testing because it wasn't covered under insurance. I have not had the drive to find another one. I don't know if this is the problem.  I feel completely lost. A saying that resonates with me is, if you want to grow, find people that are really good at what you want to get better at, and learn from them (or, seek the resources yourself and teach yourself from the ground up). I'm not sure if this a consequence of COVID, but this is the most frustrating part for me. I feel like I can't do that. What if I want to learn more about how my brain works? Biohacks to make myself more efficient, be able to do more in a day? The most efficient way to teach yourself a language? I don't know where to go to find that information. Unfortunately, PHD second-language aquisition experts are simply not available at my desire to give me the rundown, or simply point me in the right direction so that I can do the work myself. And as such, I feel stuck.  My life feels at a standstill. I want to do so many things, and learn about all these interesting things. But I feel like I'm not in control. I haven't been able to communicate these thoughts to my friends, because I feel they don't understand. They're my friends, and I love them. But because they're not proficient at the things I want to be proficient at, as I mention before, I feel as if I can't grow.   From this, I wonder where to go. A psychologist would likely not be able to help me optimize my flow when studying another language, unless they were trained in it. Unfortunately, this 'unicorn' psychologist that is extremely proficient in all my interests doesn't exist. I find myself contemplating often.  Does the university environment at large help with this? Or more specifically, an in-person one? Will immersion in an environment with hyper-driven people in my various interests help with this? Further, how does one without the benefit of college access social relationships and self-enrichment?  Does anyone else feel this at all? Has anyone else felt something like this before? Open to all feedback and criticisms (or redirects, if this isn't the right place). Thank you for your time.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,> how do you take control and initiative of your own life?  I personally put myself into obligations where if I don't meet expectations it leads to much disappointment from others or myself. Probably not the greatest approach but it produces something. For some things, I just try to make small measurable incremental improvements on.   > A theory in high school was that I had ADD,  CAPS used to do free ADHD evaluations.  > find people that are really good at what you want to get better  Very true statement, I would recommend trying to join a club with something you have an interest in and contribute.  > optimize my flow when studying another language  This is something that is pretty well understood. If you really want to learn another language you have to spend the time talking to native speakers. You can find people online to talk with who are trying to learn English. Just learn some of the basics first. I have some more specific references if you are interested.  > Will immersion in an environment with hyper-driven people in my various interests help with this?  They don't need to be hyper-driven, but joining groups that are about specific subject matters will definitely help.    > Further, how does one without the benefit of college access social relationships and self-enrichment?  If you are a personable person, you can make friends anywhere. But joining clubs or groups in your local area works. The worst way to make friends is sitting home and not having any hobby.  > Does anyone else feel this at all? Has anyone else felt something like this before?  To varying degrees throughout my life, yes.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I don‚Äôt think the university environment will help you.  Especially U of M, I found to be overwhelming, anonymous and tons of bureaucracy.  If you do have ADHD or suspect it I would suggest getting an official diagnosis and some medication and/or counseling to deal with both personal and academic issues.  I have similar problems and I found academics in some ways to be easier (hyper focus on interests) and some ways to be harder (difficulty in connecting to other students and teachers).  I would suggest at least trying to get a hold on dashing thoughts and wandering emotions before jumping headfirst into an ultra stressful environment.  Just reading your post you seem mega stressed out.  I think you need to work on that and also cut yourself some slack.  We all expect WAY too much of ourselves and the messaging you get in a university environment isn‚Äôt exactly great for that.
post,Class,neutral,When do we register for fall classes? Sorry I know this is basic info but this was my first year here as a transfer and there hasn't been much guidance in terms of logistics.  Upperclassmen in engineering if it makes a difference
comment,Class,neutral,Registration is April 5-16, your exact date and time will be on Wolverine Access on March 24th.    March 24th is also when backpacking opens    March 8th is when the [course guide](https://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/) is updated    And in the meantime, the Fall 2021 class schedule pdf has already been released: https://ro.umich.edu/sites/default/files/timesched/pdf/FA2021.pdf
comment,Class,neutral,Look for the Fall 2021 calendar [here](https://ro.umich.edu/calendars)
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Anyone know when spring semester classes are announced/posted? I‚Äôm looking to do a CR for a class that seems to have been there for the past few years, but I want to be sure. Thx!
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,I spoke with my advisor today. He told me classes will be up on the course guide on March 8th & you‚Äôll be able to backpack classes starting on March 24th.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,There is a pdf of the classes for sprint to fall 2021 already posted if you search for it. These are tentative so a lot of locations are not determined yet, but it's a start.
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,Wolverine Access class search has Spring, Summer, and Fall 2021 posted
post,Class,positive,Hey y'all! There's an exam coming up and I'm wondering if anyone had tips for what resources are best to prepare for exams. So far, I have read through all my notes. There's a lot of resources (homework, labs, textbook readings and problems, Prof. Tsing's videos, problem roulette) so I'm not sure where to start. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!
comment,Class,positive,i think the best places to look are the homeworks and piazza. there‚Äôs also a practice exam, right?
comment,Class,neutral,[deleted]
post,Health / Wellness,positive,This is my first post on Redditt, so, I'm not entirely certain how this goes but, well, I'll try my best...  Close to seven years ago, I had to undergo emergency brain surgery because part of my brain burst, and I could have died from the blood loss. I was stabilized-evidently-but it was found I had an AVM located in my brain. Essentially, AVMs are an extremely rare (one in a million I've been told) malformation that forms into masses of blood vessels where the veins are directly connected to arteries. They have a tendency to burst, and mine did.  I had to undergo years of physical therapy but, eventually, I recovered a great deal. I even did well enough in my school to get into UofM...somehow. I do, however, have a rather poor record when it comes to mathematics, with my younger brother having surpassed me in it by now. I had to meet with a tutor after the surgery, was granted what is essentially twofold extra time on tests, was allowed to work on it even after school, could gain back half the points by correcting my mistakes, and even with all of that I only was mediocre in my classes. However, I asked that same teacher to write a recommendation for my application, and he immediately accepted my offer and wrote it despite-again-me only being a mediocre student.  I'm trying to say that I work hard at mathematics, even though I'm not good at it.  Cut to today.  I'm a part of ASTRO 102 and despite meeting with tutors, attending every lecture, and doing my homework early when I can, all I have is a subpar 67%. When I meet with tutors, we basically have to do the entire thing for scatch if I've done any work on a problem, and I am never able to get what happens. I still barely understand even basic information, and I was told that this was a good class to get my math requirement filled in easily.  I CAN'T DO THIS ANY MORE  I want to get my computation or math (whichever it is) requirement waived. I don't know if I can, but, FUCK, I don't want to waste my time on this class when I could be using it for better pursuits I care about like History or English. If anyone could give me advice, I'd be indebted to you.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Have you spoken with the fine people at the SSD office?  I have a similarly complex set of health issues that has impacted how I was able to pursue my education here at UM - the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities has an important, if not always obvious, role to play in situations like these.  PM me if you'd like more info, including parts of my own story.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,I haven‚Äôt done a QR waiver before, but I did one for the language requirement. Make an appointment with your advisor and possibly SSD to fill out the paperwork for the academic board. You‚Äôll have to give a personal statement and any documentation to back up your statement.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I have a very similar condition to yours where I suffer greatly at anything STEM related. Keep your head up. I almost ended up taking that Astro class, but chose extreme weather and sophomore natural science seminar. Make sure you work with SSD closely.   But seriously. I sometimes just hate these gen Ed requirements bc then we end up taking classes that have absolutely nothing to do with what we wanna do in the future and I have to throw thousands of dollars at it. Total BS.   As far as SSD accommodations, hey! We both get double time!
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Hey there! I‚Äôve also had brain surgery, but twice, both were about a month before a semester started. My brain was open 3 weeks before sitting down for EECS 203 (which was a massive mistake).  I‚Äôd recommend scheduling a zoom meeting with SSD. My SSD contact is a fucking superhero, they‚Äôll have your back 100% if the way through.  Use them!!!
post,Sports,positive,I‚Äôm curious if anyone has had any experience volunteering, interning, or working with teams on campus (or even remotely) as a student.  If so, how did you get involved?   I‚Äôm a college gymnastics fan and would love to help the team and get involved if possible!
comment,Sports,positive,Usually teams have student managers (they may have a slightly different title then that) but essentially students that help the athletes with stuff on game day, travel with the team etc  The UMich gym Instagram has done posts/stories of their student managers. I‚Äôd encourage you to reach out to one of the current ones to find out how their got the role
comment,Sports,positive,If you're a fan of gymnastics you should definitely check out the club gymnastics team! Literally everyone is welcome, regardless of skill level. We have lots of people who have never ever done gymnastics before in their lives and have so much fun. Pm me if you have any questions or want more info! :-)
post,Degree,positive,Would it be possible to do SUGS for CSE and get a Math Major at the same time? I was hoping to do this, but I heard that it is impossible to do SUGS with a double major.
comment,Degree,positive,How much AP credit are incoming with? If you already have credit for Calc1, Calc2, ENGR101/EECS183, Physics 140/1 + Physics 240/1,  Chem 130 + Chem 125/6, and then a couple others for general elective credit, then that will clear a lot of space in your schedule.  That said. CSE + Math major is no joke especially since this is a dual degree between COE and LSA. I would either do a  CSE + Math minor or CS-LSA + Math major to reduce the number of non-major requirements.
post,Degree,positive,As I'm thinking ahead to courses I want to take in my final year, I'm making a list of what I think are courses that I can get a lot of useful information out of.  &#x200B;  So far, I'm considering these courses: EECS 367, EECS 481, EECS 483, EECS 484, EECS 489, EECS 490, and EECS 493.  &#x200B;  Can anybody who has taken any of these courses speak on how impactful/useful they were? I'm especially interested if anybody who has taken EECS 489 can speak about it. I'm really liking EECS 491 so far, I'm just not sure if taking EECS 489 is worth it considering I hated sockets in EECS 482.  &#x200B;  Thanks to any and all who respond!  &#x200B;  EDIT: As a side note, I'd like to say that I also consider a course more "useful" if the information it teaches isn't easy to learn through Google/YouTube. The less on-the-job learning I have to do, the better!
comment,Degree,positive,- I wouldn't say 483 had a ton of "useful" information, but it certainly had very fun projects. How useful the content is depends on what field you're going into, I think. Compilers are a big subfield, and I'm sure compiler knowledge doesn't hurt for systems related work, but it's pretty much totally useless for web development.     - I've heard 484 mostly can either be self learned, or is covered in 485 (probably the most useful upper level class imo unless somebody plans on never touching web systems).    - 489 has solid projects (making a proxy server, router, a new protocol), and there's a lot of information, but it's all very disjoint and not very problem-solving esque (like 482). I don't think it'd be difficult to learn the material by yourself, but the content is honestly extremely dry. Not sure if that's a pro or con for taking a class vs self teaching (probably depends on the individual). There's also some overlap with 485 regarding TCP.   - 490 has a lot of good information that's easily applicable to a lot of areas of programming, but I personally felt that the class had too much theory for my personal taste. Probably a preference thing, especially since I don't care for functional/logical programming. When I took it with Kamil, there was also some overlap in project content with 483 (where I felt that the 483 projects were much more interesting).      - 493 apparently is relatively self-teachable.
comment,Degree,positive,Older grad here, and 481 is the only of them that I personally took, but looking them up, I'd still recommend 481 most strongly. I think software engineering principles apply to everything you do, and was the most valuable course I had when working on medium to large scale development projects. It deals with meta issues of projects, and how to apply formal engineering principles to systems, rather than just knowing how to code. That knowledge can make you stand out from colleagues who haven't studied those principles.  Something like 483 compiler design is an interesting, fun topic, and doesn't hurt to know, but it's a bit esoteric, and I think for most people it's knowledge they won't directly use. Just for comparison, I think with 482, even if you never go on to design operating systems, it still teaches issues about operating systems that are broadly applicable and good to know about. I don't have the same sense with 483.  367 autonomous robotics sounds fun, and useful for *certain* projects and industries, but might be non-useful if you happen to work in areas that don't involve hardware or robotics.  484 database management systems sounds boring, but databases are such a common element in many projects that I'd think it would be quite generally useful. SQL may be completely omitted from the rest of a CS/CE curriculum, and it's good to have a working understanding of it.  Somewhat similar with 489 networking...that's an element of so many types of systems, although your exposure to socket programming from 482 is probably enough to get you started on whatever you'd need to learn for a project in practice. The projects sound like applying different protocols to the same basic ideas. Useful but maybe not so critical.  493 UI development, while it's a broadly useful topic, I feel like that's an area where you can do just fine without a course on it. Like a person with good common sense and visual design skills would probably still be better at UI design than somebody lacking those attributes who did take a course in it.
comment,Degree,positive,EECS 485 is really good as well if you haven't taken it.
comment,Degree,positive,I‚Äôm in 440 Search Engine Design rn for my MDE and it‚Äôs a great class. The project seems like it will be lots of fun (early stages so far) and working in a team of 6 is a different but useful dynamic to work in compared to other EECS classes.
comment,Degree,positive,482 is a must they say, i‚Äôm in 490 rn and it‚Äôs really good but kinda mathy in a good way, 388 is pretty fun and very useful so far
comment,Degree,positive,490 is way more useful in real life than most classes. Databases and PL are probably the most useful skills to making you an effective software engineer
post,New Student,positive,Starting fall of this year. I am so incredibly honored and excited to have been accepted to such a great school and program. My wife and I will be moving to the area from Dayton, OH sometime this summer. Are there any fellow MURP students in the sub?

comment,New Student,positive,Congrats and welcome to the program! I'll be a year ahead of you - always happy to chat. You'll be inundated with plenty of MURP love when you get here, too :)
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Basically title, I just got a midterm grade that was much less than ideal for physics class, and I am hoping to be a physics or astrophysics major (I'm a freshman). Is it a bad idea to convert to a pass/fail for a class that is so central to my intended major? TIA.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,It‚Äôs fine unless you intend to go on to graduate school, in which case you should speak with an advisor.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre allowed to pass fail courses intended for your major but idk if it changed with the new covid rules for this semester
post,Finances,negative,Hi all.  So I've called and spoken with the Financial Aid office and emailed them a few times regarding how much aid I have left to use. According to them, I have 4.5 terms of Michigan grant left and 6.5 terms of federal, because I've only used up 5.5 terms.  I guess I'm confused as to how they're calculating terms, because I've taken aid every semester I've been here:  Freshman year: fall, winter, spring (2.5) Sophomore year: fall, winter, spring, summer (3) Junior year: fall, winter (now) (2)  This should be 7.5 terms, right ?   Perhaps I'm calculating wrong? I'm trying to figure this out now to see what my options are for spring/summer this year.
comment,Finances,neutral,I think you're calculating it right...fall/winter is 1 term and spring/summer is 0.5 terms each (1 term when combined. Not sure why the OFA is saying you have 5.5 terms as, it should be, 7.5. Go to wolverine access to see if the error is listed there:  Wolverine Access > Student Business > Financial Aid > Aid year 2021 > Eligibility Information  There should be enough info there to help you figure out where the error is!
comment,Finances,neutral,I know the number of terms of aid left number gets updated oddly on Wolverine Access. I've run into a similar issue as you before, don't remember what the discrepancy was though.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm in state for UIUC which so it costs a LOT less than UMich for me. I‚Äôm essentially just wondering, is there anything you feel is so much better about UMich CS that it‚Äôs worth the extra money? Or, if any else faced a similar choice, what made you choose UMich?  Edit: Thank you all! This was extremely helpful for me.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Go to UIUC
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It‚Äôs not worth an extra $100K vs. UIUC. The degrees are ranked very similarly and both programs are target schools for CS recruiting or building a competitive application for grad school.   Use the extra money for a down payment on a home, a new car after graduation, a summer traveling the world, your wedding, some great vacations, a good chunk of a MBA...whatever floats your boat. Unless $100K is totally immaterial to you and your family.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,yeah stay in state, UIUC is a good engineering school and umich out of state isn't worth it
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Here‚Äôs another thing: UIUC is a mediocre school outside their engineering program. Michigan is top notch at just about everything. If you decide that you don‚Äôt want to do CS, then you‚Äôre screwed if you‚Äôre still at UIUC.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Uiuc cs is better than umich cs lol
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hi, UMich CS major from Illinois. I was in a similar spot to you. If you only want to study CS, then go to UIUC, but if you are interested in exploring other areas beyond CS (math, sciences, social sciences, other types of engineering, etc.), then Michigan is a better school. UIUC and Michigan have top ranking CS departments, but outside of CS, Michigan is a better school in most other departments, so that's why I went here.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,U of M has a better football team,  but I don't think that's worth the extra $. :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Go to UIUC especially if you got in for CS. UMich cs is flooded with students because it is open for everyone. Also looking at the UIUC course guide it looks like they offer a lot more courses. Being completely honest UIUC is a better program.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UMich grad here. I'd think the quality of undergrad CS education probably isn't significant. You'll learn what you'll need to know to begin your career either place, either school will get your foot in the door with grad schools or prospective employers, and ultimately where that leads you is going to depend much, much more on you than on differences in a few classes.  Some people pointed out UM gives you better options outside CS, and that's a valid consideration if you aren't confident CS is the field for you. If you're passionate about the field, like you spend your free time coding for fun, that probably won't happen.  The only other difference I might consider is other students you're exposed to; being around smart people can be beneficial for learning while you're there, even outside your field, plus some may become friends long after school, so a better school overall has advantages in that regard. I don't know how big that difference would be between UIUC and UM (it's certainly an unquantifiable factor), though I'd guess it's less of a difference than between either of those and elite private schools like MIT or Harvard, where I think the more competitive admissions process does attract higher achieving students *on average*.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,fwiw, all of my friends who graduated from UIUC CS had great college experiences, and had no problem finding high-quality, high-paying jobs in interesting places (Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, Seattle).   So spend as little money as you can now, so the high-paying salary you get later isn't just paying off your debt.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As someone who works in Big tech and ran multiple hackathons go to UIUC. Great school and in state cost. It‚Äôs not worth going into debt for CS, especially when your experiences and opportunities can be done through passion projects :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Where ever you go for CS you‚Äôll be just fine. Umich CS rankings might be higher but it‚Äôs also higher at the cost of your mental health-especially if you aren‚Äôt used to a very academically rigorous course. I would recommend going for something cheaper! As long as you can develop a passion for CS and you have a solid base you‚Äôll do fine in the future when it comes to job hunting time.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Keep in mind that most departmental rankings place all their emphasis on research. That may or may not positively correlate with undergraduate education/teaching. In most science fields there is no difference between the two schools in terms of the usual research metrics. There is no established medical school at uiuc, so that impacts research in the life sciences and adjacent departments (like BME).
comment,Prospective Student,positive,As someone who went to UIUC undergrad and is here for a grad program, I‚Äôd stay in state. The best thing IMO is being in as little debt as possible upon graduation - it helps so much stress and life wise after.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Your experience at UIUC and UM will probably be similar for CS, with both schools being big public state schools  Would recommend UIUC for cost alone
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Unless you are able to comfortably pay out of pocket, it‚Äôs hard to think of any justification to choose Michigan CS over UIUC. Especially considering that department can‚Äôt seem to go 3 months without a major sex scandal.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,UMich CS is probably worth the OOS cost, but not if you're in-state for UIUC

comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Ideas like this work great. Having both police and mental health professionals respond to a psychiatric emergency is the optimal program and I‚Äôm glad that Ann Arbor is going ahead with this. Mental health professionals will attempt to deescalate a situation and police will be there for back up to ensure the safety of everyone in the event that someone may be armed or dangerous.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Like everything the city tries to do, it always goes super well........ I do hope our city is able to adequately provide a mental health service for our city. Too bad the people that run this city are either clueless or petty.

post,Housing,positive,So I'm currently a freshman who's never stepped on campus due to the pandemic, and I am considering my housing options for fall '21. I am considering between a dorm or an apartment, but I am not sure if it's too late for an apartment. I barely know anyone so I'm not sure who I would live with, and I was kind of hesitant about choosing who to live with just by talking to potential roommates online, if that makes sense.   I was also not sure if it is guaranteed or possible for sophomores to get a dorm. What do you guys think is the best option? Would I be missing out if I didn't dorm at all during my 4 years, since I didn't get to this year? Also, if it is possible to dorm, what is it like being in the dorms as a sophomore?
comment,Housing,positive,I lived in Bursley freshman and sophmore year and Northwood junior year. I‚Äôm insane I know. I enjoyed it honestly, sometimes I miss burs. It helps I was rooming with a friend all three years. I‚Äôm at Courtyards now and I love it there too, it‚Äôs just a different vibe - it has its ups and downs compared to the dorms.   As far as chances of getting a dorm it‚Äôs pretty easy as a sophmore and you get to pick down to the room. Stockwell is sophmore only I think but it‚Äôs a lot of singles and it fills up kind of quickly so you have to get a little lucky with your selection time
comment,Housing,neutral,Apartment is far superior.  You don‚Äôt have anyone breathing down your neck about rules as long as you‚Äôre not a nuisance to your neighbors and you can actually have a choice about what amenities you do or don‚Äôt want to pay for.  The only real downside is the lack of included meal plan but you can still get a meal plan even if you‚Äôre not in a dorm.
comment,Housing,positive,I would live in the dorms if only to get the experience and meet people. Once you have some in person friends you can find a place to live junior year
comment,Housing,neutral,Dorms might still be strict on Covid next year. Apartments won‚Äôt be.
comment,Housing,positive,I'm a freshman and dormed this year. Personally I enjoyed enjoyed the dorms and I feel like it's something you have to experice at least once. Next year they might be even stricter on covid depending how it goes but you'll still be able to meet people. As for apartments if you have like 1 more friend, you could still find apartments for <$1800/month total so <$900/person there are plenty left relatively close to campus (speaking from personal bc I just signed a lease w/ a friend for about $1800).
comment,Housing,positive,I was in a great dorm freshman year (west quad) but still elected to get an apartment in my sophomore year. There are a ton of benefits to moving into an apartment vs. staying in the dorms, including but not limited to:     1) Personal freedom. I could drink/do whatever I felt like with no RA to worry about. Granted my RA freshman year was pretty relaxed, but the piece of mind was nice.  2) Privacy. I had a roommate, but we each had our own room. This meant I could go to bed (or be up all night working) in my own apartment whenever I wanted. When I was in the dorms, I wanted to be respectful of my roommates schedule (and vice versa) so if one person in the dorm was sleeping the other can't be in there not sleeping.  3) Cooking. With your own kitchen you won't be stuck with a meal plan that you can only use during certain hours. Yeah, cooking is an effort, but it's easy, cheap, and healthy once you get used to it.   4) Cost: A 2 bedroom apartment (where I had my own room) costs 50% of what I'd pay to SHARE a room the size of my bedroom with someone else, and I'd need to share a bathroom with an entire hall and a kitchen with an entire building. When I moved into a studio as an upperclassman, I paid maybe 70% of a typical dorm monthly fee. Not to mention I spent parts of my sophomore/junior year summers in Ann Arbor and I didn't need to worry about getting a sublet.  &#x200B;  Overall, I'd strongly recommend getting an apartment. It's cheaper, you have more freedom and privacy, you aren't stuck with a meal plan, and you aren't beholden to the dorm picking lottery (odds are you'll be stuck in Northwood).   &#x200B;  To play devils advocate, it was a really fun bonding experience being in the dorms, and it's definitely something that's nice to do at least for 1 year. That being said, the dorm experience will be quite different for a sophomore than for a freshman, so I'm not sure you'll get out of it what I got out of it.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Specifically the classes, thank you in advance.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Many Ross classes do not have room for students who are not in the BBA or minor in business. But some classes have open seats after the Ross students register, and others can join. I took a couple Ross classes that way as an upperclassman in the CoE. (One of the classes I took was ACC 471, which is an accounting class for non-BBAs. Most students in the class were from engineering.)   Other Ross ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù like their career center and events are even harder to access if you aren‚Äôt a BBA student.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,You're likely going to have to check with the ross office that runs the real advise program.  They may even make exceptions as well if there is room in the program. Some may be limited to mbas.
post,Student Organization,negative,Trying to see if my student org can meet in one of the Mason Hall classrooms within the "ten people or less" regulation.  Our group usually meets late at night due to conflicting schedules. Pre-covid, it was really no problem getting an open room somewhere around 9-10 pm. On the SOAS website it's a little unclear if these free rooms are still available, and for what hours/days.   Has anyone who has done meetings in Mason/Angell recently aware of current policies? Thx
post,Prospective Student,positive,How hard is the coursework? I know that if I got in they think I can manage it but I have a bit of impostor syndrome when it comes to this. I did my undergrad in IE at Northwestern and my GPA was a 3.25. However, I didn‚Äôt always do too well in engineering courses.   How collaborative is it? Or are people really just worrying about themselves?   Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,"collaboration" is hard right now because being remote is weird, but I wouldn't call the department cutthroat or anything.  People are generally decent humans.  I don't have any classes that are like "don't you dare talk to your classmates about homework," either, like some of the IOE UG courses.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Not a graduate student but I can tell you that the IOE Department has some of the best faculty and staff members out there in engineering (& all of campus). Really friendly, intelligent, and overall passionate about their work.
post,Finances,positive,I‚Äôm considering Michigan for aerospace engineering undergrad next year and applied for this ‚ÄúGeisinger Scholarship‚Äù at the beginning of the month, and if I remember correctly it said to expect results ‚Äúlate February‚Äù but I‚Äôm not positive.

comment,Finances,positive,i didnt hear back either lol; they said they would mail out decisions at the end of February, so maybe the decisions are on their way??
post,Prospective Student,positive,The Hoeft Technology and Management Program (or T&M minor) is a minor that combines business management and the student's engineering major. It gives you the chance to meet and work with business students and go to international business conferences, both for other's projects and your own.  Does UofM at Ann Arbor have something similar to this? If you've got experience with it, how is/was it?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Closest thing I‚Äôve heard of Engineering Global Leaders (EGL). The premise is it combines engineering students and MBA students together to work on operations internships and projects. It‚Äôs a student org but also a part of the honors engineering program. Great group of people and you also get access to some Ross classes you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to take.  If you have any questions, DM me!
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I am a student from Ann Arbor and I'm looking to take linear algebra (or any course to cover MATH214 or MATH217 requirements) at an "easier" college and transfer credit to UM. Would WCC or Eastern be the better choice for cost and education while still remaining relatively easy? I am also working a full time internship so I am hoping to do this class on top of that. Which course would I need to take at either of these colleges and how is the transfer credit process and registration process? If anyone else has taken a math class in Ann Arbor at a different university and can give their experiences that would help. Also, I understand that I would not get as the Michigan level or coverage of the course outside of UM but I am an EE student that wants to take Linear Algebra for the purpose of expanding into certain areas of CS such as autonomous robotics (EECS 367), machine learning (EECS 445), and computer vision (EECS 442) which all have linear algebra as a PreReq. Thanks!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I transferred to UM from WCC after completing most of an associate's degree. Larry David for MTH 197 is the way to go with Linear Algebra there! He's the course coordinator and was also a personal mentor for me; he really enjoys the subject and loves teaching it. I really enjoyed the Linear Algebra course and found it easy to pick up and teach myself when I wanted to get ahead.   Registration for the course is very simple and you should have no problems if you've already taken calc (it's not a prereq itself, but having taken those classes you'll have what you need).  You can't beat the cost of WCC, and the transfer is easy for UM. I hear a lot of people talk about how some of their credits didn't transfer in weird ways, but every single one of mine (58) transferred without a problem, including Linear Algebra. Just be sure to not take the purely online course, take the virtual classroom. I don't believe online math classes transfer to UM, but the virtual classroom ones will. Double check!  Best of luck!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I wouldn't assume you get a "lower" standard of education outside UofM. I transferred from WCC, and on the whole, I've been much more satisfied with my academic experience at WCC than here.  It might not be a fair comparison in some areas given the circumstances imposed by the pandemic, but here are the primary differences I've found between WCC and UofM:  \- WCC blows the pants off of UofM for online instruction and support  \- Difficulty of class material and quality instruction is dependent on the class and instructor as always, but I've been more satisfied WCC instructors than UofM instructors. RateMyProfessors is key, and part-time instructors can be risky -- I've had extremely good and extremely poor experiences with part-time instructors without much in between.  \- IME, equivalent classes aren't more rigorous or difficult at UofM, but UofM loves making you beat a dead horse with busywork whereas courses at WCC generally prescribe less coursework without sacrificing learning outcomes  All this being said, linear algebra has been on my list of courses I'd like to take as well, and I haven't been able to find a good instructor for it at WCC as of yet. If you see a section taught by Mohammed Abella, snag a seat ASAP.  Let me know if you have any questions or want to run an instructor's name by me; I'm pretty familiar with most of their STEM instructors and some of their humanities instructors.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Curse Equivalency database is a resource that allows you to identify which courses at other universities/colleges are accepted at UM (and specifically CoE) as many frequently transferred courses: https://apps.engin.umich.edu/equivalencies/. The coverage of schools in Michigan is complete or nearly complete, and pretty comprehensive for other US schools.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,If you need Math 217 specifically, it's apparently incredibly difficult to transfer from anywhere. As someone who is in zoom Math 217, I wholeheartedly regret taking it this semester. If you're just in it for the computational side, it seems that it's kinda all the same most places, so if you can transfer it, I would just do it.
post,Finances,negative,Does anyone have any updates on financial aid requests for this spring/summer? The financial aid site says information will be available in February, and tomorrow is March already so I‚Äôm nervous I missed something. Anyone know anything?
comment,Finances,neutral,I got an email a few days ago with an update that included [this link](https://finaid.umich.edu/new-approach-springsummer-aid) about spring/summer aid. Basically, no need to apply as long as you've submitted and completed the financial aid process for fall and winter. You should receive an email with your estimate in early March.
post,Class,neutral,I'm thinking of taking 370 this upcoming spring. Do you think it is doable along w/ a full-time internship?
comment,Class,negative,it was the worst thing ive ever done, hardest class in my 4 years
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôve taken other classes in spring semester. It‚Äôs safe to assume that a hard class will be even harder in the spring
comment,Class,positive,I honestly didn‚Äôt think it was bad at all, but with an internship you will definitely be busy every day if you want to do well in the course
comment,Class,positive,I took 370 over the spring semester and really enjoyed it. However, I was only working part time and 370 is one of my favorite courses, so my opinion might not match your situation. I definitely think its doable if you stay on top of it. There are points when lecture content picks up pace. Also, you need to start projects early because you are given less time in the spring. On the plus side, office hours are better because of less students.
comment,Class,positive,I had a friend who took EECS 370 in the spring term. It's not a TON of work by any means, but your time is better spent actually getting the best out of your internship, especially if you'd like it to translate into an offer. Could your internship delay its start date to accomodate you taking EECS in the spring term? During my junior year, I was able to squeeze an REU and an internship into the same summer (since Michigan summer breaks are just that long). A lot of schools (especially those on the quarter system) only start their summer vacation around when spring term ends, so it's certainly possible that they let you start later.

comment,Class,positive,I took EECS 203 and EECS 280 together sp20, and it was alright. Since COVID-19 was going on, and I basically couldn't go anywhere or do anything, I had a crap ton of time to work on both classes and was forced to work on the classes since I couldn't be like "lemme go out and hang with friends". I will say that you definitely do spend a lot of time on these classes: it's basically a full time job and more if you want to do well. For 280, you can't start projects a little later anymore since the time is cut in half (you get more submits), and same idea with 203 hw.   &#x200B;  A warning: if you do decide to take these classes together, you don't have much grace of slacking/falling behind that you have in a normal semester since everything is double the pace. One thing I did to give myself a little cushion is between the time of winter semester and spring semester was get ahead in eecs 280 since all material is published on their website. This gives you some breathing room before the classes start to ramp up.  I personally would mostly warn against taking the classes together unless you're feeling pretty confident. Rather, if you have the chance, it may be smarter to take EECS 280 at Michigan and take a EECS 203 equivalent at a local college to transfer over in a separate time frame so you won't be bombarded with too much work at the same time.  tldr: possible, but hard. Need to stay on top of classes, and little leeway in falling behind in material.
comment,Class,positive,I would recommend against it. Most people I've talked to who have tried have regretted it and many have needed to retake one or the other in the Fall.  If you add up the hours you will be in lecture and lab (280 has mandatory labs this semester and did last Spring) and schedule time for meals and sleep, see if you're comfortable with the time you'd have left for coding projects + 203 homeworks + studying for 203 exams + studying for 280 exams + office hours for 203 + office hours for 280.  If you are confident you'd get an easy A in both courses, then you might be in the set of people who could give this a try, but you'd probably not get the grade you're happy with in at least one of them. If you think either course will need effort, I'd recommend taking one in the Spring and the other in the Fall.

comment,Satellite Campus,negative,Um... no offense, buddy, but you don't want to start demanding equal treatment between Dearborn and Ann Arbor on the basis that *Ann Arbor* receives worse treatment. And I say this as someone who goes to the flagship, Ann Arbor campus.   https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/05/16/um-equity-dearborn-flint-campus-one-university/1167455001/ (Although, I do think the funding statement is a little biased; Dearborn students paying 80% of Ann Arbor in-state tuition ignores the vast number of out-of-state students bringing money into Ann Arbor. However, the point stands.)
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,UM Dearborn has a very different student population. Most students are in state and have far less disposable income, so there‚Äôs less concern about going back and forth to visit family out of state or to go on vacations over school breaks (like many Ann Arbor students normally do over fall break, spring break, MLK weekend, etc). Also, most students are commuters, even in normal times.   This isn‚Äôt a fair comparison.  And change.org is a for-profit entity (a B Corp) that sells your information.

comment,Student Organization,neutral,There's 3 other secret clubs at the University if you didn't know.
comment,Student Organization,positive,What's sad about this (to me) is that a group like this has potential to do genuine good.  My undergrad has a lot of secret societies, most of them were silly/fun/whatever, but at least one of them had the same purpose as Order of Angell supposedly did:  recruit respected, involved students from various majors and clubs who could quietly and effectively advocate for needed change on campus.  A group like that can be a positive force and direct university attention/action to stuff that is important to students.    Hard to tell whether Order of the A can emerge from this cloud to make it true for them.

post,Finances,positive,I received an informal email earlier in the week about being admitted to the M.S. program. My formal admissions email came today with no mention of funding. I logged into the portal and went to the funding summary and there was nothing. Is this typical (no funding), or does the funding award come later? The degree is $94k and I was under the impression it was at least partially funded... if any SEAS students can share their experience, I‚Äôd appreciate it thanks!
comment,Finances,positive,Yes, that is typical. Most Master‚Äôs degrees at Michigan are unfunded. If there is any guaranteed funding package as part of your admission it will usually be included with the letter.   From my experience SEAS Master‚Äôs students do have a better chance at getting funded teaching positions (GSIs, Graduate Student Instructor) than other Master‚Äôs programs at Michigan, but those are applied for on a semester by semester basis.
comment,Finances,neutral,Yikes.  Sorry you're learning this at this stage in the process, but you should not anticipate any funding.

However, I received a rejection letter from Taubman today (I thought decisions come out late March/early April??). I know preferred admission is considered after gaining entry into one school. I haven't heard back from Stamps yet but I was wondering if it would be possible for them to re-evaluate my application for preferred admissions to Taubman even after this rejection. Also, after applying regular decision, why did I receive my decision in less than a month instead of at the same time as everyone else???
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The university has rolling admissions, with earliest acceptances/rejections for fall starts beginning in January and often running through into March/April. The people who hear back in January/early February are the people who are "easy choices" for admissions to decide ‚Äî people who are either more than qualified to get in, or are *throwaway candidates* who are nowhere near the minimums. Since this is late February, I would imagine you were not an "easy rejection" from Taubman, but still did not meet their expectations.  *Preferred admissions* exists when you get accepted into two or more colleges within the university, but you have a *preference* on which one you would rather attend. For example, someone accepted into LSA and Engineering with preferred admissions to LSA, would ultimately attend LSA. Preferred admissions isn't applicable to a situation in which a student has been *rejected* from a college to which they applied.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Midterms week. 65/100 on first exam.   Can I do better? Of course. Didn't attend 80% of lectures due to asynchronous procrastination.   Just here to let everyone know that if you do poorly on your first exam, things will be okay. Readjust and work on yourself/your routines and we'll all pull through. There are still P/F options if you can make it  to the end!  Don't beat yourself up over past mistakes, you can only move forward.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Want to know how I did on my first ever exam in community college? 68%.  Want to know how I did on my second exam ever in community college? 39%.  Want to know what I'm doing now? Attending law school on a large academic/merit scholarship.  Your first exam doesn't define you. Your second exam doesn't define you. Hell, not even a single class defines you, nor does an entire semester. Your GPA is not your identity. Your value as a person is not determines by a letter grade in a class.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Well said! Good luck everyone!
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thank you, I needed this
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,My first ever high school CS exam I got a 49%. I literally thought I‚Äôd never learn to code but here I am doing CS.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thank you so much. I‚Äôve been procrastinating with just hanging out with friends on voice chats and being stuck in my room 24/7. It‚Äôs been tough, but I actually pulled through and didn‚Äôt bomb my first exam (still did poorly), but not as bad as I thought. I guess the only thing we can do is to create a positive mindset and try to make the best out of every unfortunate thing we get in.
post,Finances,positive,I know it's like getting a W, but does that threaten my aid? This class is  giving me such a hard time and anxiety. I'm doing my best but it fully relies on a program with few tutorials . I'm finally getting a hang of itsort of so I'm hoping for the best.  &#x200B;  Thank you in advance.
comment,Finances,positive,For financial aid questions, it's best to email the office directly because no one here knows your situation and the advice given here isn't official and may not be accurate.
comment,Finances,positive,Hmmm I've gotten a W before and it didn't effect my financial aid but I believe that the financial aid office still checks if you are making satisfactory academic progress and if you aren't then that could affect your financial aid.  I also received a NRC last winter but that was for an incomplete and the NRC was probably put into the system well after the financial aid office checks for satisfactory academic progress.   Worst-case scenario you get your financial aid revoked and you have to submit an appeal to get it back. I've submitted an appeal twice when they've revoked my financial aid and both times they approved my appeal.   I hope everything works out for you!

post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Hey all, I'm considering taking Math 316 and Physics 240/1 together during the spring term (unless I completely burn out by then lmfao) Has anyone done this before? Do these classes synergize at least okay? I know 240 sucks, but is it much worse during spring? Any insight is appreciated!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,you didn‚Äôt mention whether or not you‚Äôre planning to take these courses at umich, but as someone who took 240 here last semester i highly recommend taking it somewhere else
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,I did physics 235 summer semester (NOTE- easier than 240!) and hated it. I could never do 240+ math 316 in spring together. But if you‚Äôre a physics/math person, more power to you
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi! I got an acceptance from the school of engineering  where I plan to major in CS. My question is whether it's feasible to do a business minor from Ross. I want to do this without compromising on my CS experience, so I don't want to sacrifice on things like internships. Is this doable? How much could it affect social life. For context, I have AP credits from Calc BC, Chemistry, CS A, and Physics C Mech.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Eh I'm doing CS eng major with BBA major, it's not that rough tbh like Ross classes are p free, only issue is you can't really take "for fun" classes or have less than 16 credits a semester (I've been 18 all 4 semesters). Internship wise it doesn't really impact anything except give you more options and something to help u stand out. If you have any ?s feel free to DM me!
post,Class,positive,I‚Äôm a grad student in engineering and know a good bit of Python and c++ (and matlab lol) but mostly as scripting languages. I‚Äôm hoping to take a course that teaches good practices for object oriented programming, version management, exceptions handling, etc. At the very least, I want to learn more about how to use GitHub effectively so I can move projects there and have my GH page as a portfolio. My preference would be for a UMich course but I‚Äôd consider something free online if that‚Äôs the best route. EECS 402, 403, or 490 could look promising. Any suggestions?
comment,Class,positive,201 has good git and other fun useful stuff, 1 credit. there‚Äôs a software engineering course with prof Leach, 481 , 4 credits, does git and versions and good practice stuff i‚Äôve heard. 490 is a no for sure, it‚Äôs a programming languages course which explores the topic through the functional language OCaml. 402, 403 i haven‚Äôt heard of
comment,Class,positive,I believe 403 is taught alongside EECS 281, which is an incredibly well-taught class for learning CS concepts and C++. If you have the background for that I'd highly recommend it, since it will directly help with object oriented programming and exceptions. Like others said, 201 goes more directly into things like Git, so if you can audit it that could be helpful.
comment,Class,neutral,EECS 201 - Computer Science Pragmatics
comment,Class,positive,EECS 381 was the best class for object oriented programming and writing good c++, but unfortunately it's gone now. The [website](http://umich.edu/~eecs381/) is still up, with many excellent handouts. I imagine it also covered exception handling.  &#x200B;  [EECS 280](https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/23_Exceptions.html?highlight=exceptions) covers exception handling briefly, but not much.  &#x200B;  As far as version management, git, github, and other logistical/tools based things, I'd strongly recommend eecs 201. It's a 1 credit course (though I'd say it's higher than a 1 credit workload), but it covers all sorts of things, it's very useful. There's a [website](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs201/) as well, take a look to see if you'd like it.  &#x200B;  There's also eecs 481 as was mentioned, which covers a lot of software engineering concepts, though not necessarily the things you mentioned. I bet you'll never guess what's next... that's right, there's a [website](https://dijkstra.eecs.umich.edu/kleach/eecs481/w21/index.php).  &#x200B;  EECS 403 is the same as EECS 281 (I'm an IA for it). It goes deep into algorithms and how data structures work, but doesn't cover Object Oriented Programming specifically. You can choose to make your programs object oriented if you want, or you don't have to, so if that's something you're looking for specifically, 403 might not be for you. It is a good course if you want more experience in C++ or want to learn how to write some more difficult programs. (there's no website unfortunately lol).  &#x200B;  I don't know anything about EECS 402, but EECS 490, as others have mentioned, is probably not what you're looking for.
comment,Class,positive,EECS 381 was legendary for this, but unfortunately I don't think they'll ever bring the course back... keep an eye out though. I think professor Kieras' notes will make a good read for you though, check them out at this site http://umich.edu/~eecs381/  Nevertheless, I've heard good things about EECS 201!
comment,Class,positive,201 sounds like what you're looking for.    I wouldn't recommend 490 as is with Cyrus Omar as it's more theoretical. I'd probably look into the old EECS 490 which is now sometimes offered as a special topics: https://amirkamil.github.io/eecs398/syllabus.html which I've heard good things about and should be more applicable/approachable than the current 490.
post,New Student,positive,I‚Äôve never had the chance to visit the UM campus so I‚Äôm not sure what the merch prices are there...  Is it worth buying on the mden website or wait till august?  Thanks.
comment,New Student,positive,If you‚Äôre shopping for the best prices, wait until you come to campus and look at the sale / value room (or whatever they call it) upstairs. Not all of that stuff makes it onto the website.   In addition to the MDen, I would check out Underground Printing and The Bo Store.   There‚Äôs also sometimes cheap gear at grocery stores like Meijer or Walmart. Depending on your style, you may or may not like the options.   You‚Äôll also get plenty of free t-shirts as a freshman.
comment,New Student,neutral,I always buy from MDEN online, they almost always have sales going
post,Class,positive,Has anyone taken this class? What is the grade breakdown/workload like? Hw's? exams? labs? etc.  Are the concepts easy to grasp? I haven't taken any ioe courses.  Atlas seems to show a high workload, but it is only a 2 credit class, so I am a little suspicious.
comment,Class,positive,I don‚Äôt remember the class (homework, exams) being particularly hard or IOE-specific and it‚Äôs relatively useful stuff. There are no labs. If you emailed the instructor and asked for a copy of the syllabus, I‚Äôm sure she would send you one.   Levantrosser is kind of polarizing. I personally don‚Äôt enjoy her personality. But it wasn‚Äôt so bad that I couldn‚Äôt complete the class. (And other people really like her.)
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm in it right now. It‚Äôs a lot of work for a 2 credit class because it‚Äôs a half semester class. Group projects are pretty time consuming
post,Health / Wellness,positive,I've never had an HMO plan, so a little confused: do I have to make an appointment with my PCP for a referral every time I want to see a specialist(in this case a gynecologist) ? What if the PCP who was assigned to me has no available appointment till April? Does that just mean I can't get the care I want until then?  Any clarification would be appreciated! Ideally I just want to go to the UHS Women's health clinic, but I'm unsure if that's allowed without a referral.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,1. You don‚Äôt need to use insurance at all to use UHS for a gynecology exam  2. I would recommend contacting the student insurance office to learn more about your plan   https://uhs.umich.edu/healthinsuranceplans  https://uhs.umich.edu/howinsurance  https://uhs.umich.edu/faqs  Unsolicited advice: Monique Steel is a really great provider at the UHS Gynecology and Sexual Health Clinic. I would highly recommend seeing her if it‚Äôs an option.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,My understanding is that you need a referral for the first time you see a specialist, but once care is established with them then you can just schedule appointments directly. I have the staff insurance plan that is the same as GradCare and that's how it has worked for me. As u/purpleandpenguins said you don't need a referral to go to a specialist at UHS.   For the future, if you wanted/needed you are also able to switch your primary care doctor to someone else. The UM patient portal allows you to look at primary care doctors in the area accepting new patients (though definitely call their office to make sure that info is up to date).
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,For gynecological care specifically, you do not need a referral regardless of who you visit. See page 19 of the Certificate of Coverage (basically the terms and conditions of the plan).   [Link to the GradCare Certificate of Coverage](https://hr.umich.edu/sites/default/files/2020-gradcare-cert-coverage.pdf)   Further, as someone notes, you may see a gynecologist at UHS at no charge, and your insurance won't be billed at all. I also **strongly recommend** making someone at UHS (it can even be the gynecologist you see) your primary care physician if you're going to use UHS as your first point of care for most things. Just email the Managed Care/Student Insurance office at [UHS-mancare-stuins@med.umich.edu](mailto:UHS-mancare-stuins@med.umich.edu) and they can help you if you know who you want to choose. Should you set your PCP as someone at UHS, *any UHS physician, NP, or PA can write you a referral to any specialist and BCN will recognize it*. I've had an excellent experience having a UHS PCP. And no copays at UHS!
post,Miscellaneous,neutral,Anyone else just get a text:  "UM EAlert  UM Emergency Alert"  with no further details and nothing to click on to learn more?

post,COVID-19,negative,Anyone have any idea on how these will go next semester? We‚Äôll (likely) be back on campus, but masked. I don‚Äôt see how we can be expected to learn a new language like that. I expect a ‚Äúfuck you, pay me‚Äù from em, but wondering if anyone has more insight?
comment,COVID-19,positive,I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not clear on how masks prevent you from learning a foreign language.
comment,COVID-19,positive,There are clear panel masks now on the market. I hope your professor would have one of these.
comment,COVID-19,positive,It‚Äôs near impossible to have clear annunciation with a mask on. Most importantly, you won‚Äôt be able to see how the prof moves their mouth- which is a huge part of learning annunciation.
post,Health / Wellness,negative,I keep doing consistently poorly in one of my classes. I was looking through our last assignment and I completely misread the directions that made up a significant portion of it. I know I‚Äôm going to get a lot of points taken off, which is frustrating because I understand the material, I just keep making stupid mistakes or glossing over things.   Feeling very disheartened and overwhelmed about it. But I also feel like I can‚Äôt take time to address it because if I‚Äôm not constantly working I‚Äôll fall behind. Every time I finish one task, two more pop up. I feel like I‚Äôm not making any progress and we‚Äôre only halfway through the semester. If I drop a class then I won‚Äôt be able to graduate, and I‚Äôm working 20 hours a week to pay for school as it is.   Would love to hear how other folks deal with the constant feeling of being busy and overwhelmed. I really don‚Äôt know if I can do another 6 or 7 weeks of this  Edit: thanks for all the thoughtful responses. I wrote this at 5 AM when I was having an existential crisis and couldn‚Äôt sleep. Hang in there everyone, and don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre not alone in this!
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I recommend talking to a grandma. Not necessarily *your* grandma, but one as old as you can find. They really know how to put things in perspective.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I feel you. I‚Äôm taking 18 credits and working part time too. I feel constantly overwhelmed even when I‚Äôve completed all my work for the week. It‚Äôs hard on me mentally and physically since stress makes my IBD flare up and I‚Äôm always feeling sick.  What‚Äôs getting me through this semester is pass/nrc. If you can, pick a class or two to get a pass in. Meditation also helps me a lot with managing stress and it‚Äôs something quick you can do during the day.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,It's tough, and a challenge a lot of people share.   What's worked for me:  1. Getting organized 2. Prioritizing time: decide what's essential, and what can be put off 3. Eliminating social media, doom scrolling, gaming, porn and TV 4. Getting 8 hours of sleep (by eliminating social media, doom scrolling, gaming, porn and TV) 5. Exercise: bike to school instead of drive. This can clear your mind and help with focus 6. Remembering that tens of thousands of people have made it through before. If they can do it, we can too  It's still not easy, but adopt any of those ideas that may work for you, and I really think it'll make a difference.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I am so sorry you are in this place. I have been there too, and I remember the sinking, hard-to-breath feeling that accompanied my panic.   1) Can any of these classes be moved to a pass/fail grade? [According to the Office of Register website, you can request a Pass/Fail grade up to six months following the end of term](https://ro.umich.edu/records-registration/covid-19-fall20-winter21-grading). There are some restrictions or issues depending on your long term goal. It's not an end-all-be-all solution but it's a start.   2) Get off the computer. If you need to read articles for class, download them and send them to an e-reader. Read the articles in a different space than where you do school work. That will help keep you focused on the material, and keep your brain from attempting to jump to the next task.   3) Hand write an abbreviated list of project and paper requires. Writing helps your brain retain the information. Writing will also help you pick out the required steps necessary for the project. Then you can review the abbreviated steps when double checking your work rather than searching through the professor's instructions.   4) Reduce your work time if possible. It may not be feasible. If something needs to give, focus on school for right now. You'll be able to work more hours once school has ended.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,I was thinking that it may be good to begin taking some supplements both for general health purposes and to help with school/studying. Does anyone here have any positive experiences or recommendations for a certain supplement? What noticeable changes did you observe?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Supplements are hardly regulated in the US. I would not recommend taking any, especially without consulting your doctor. (And if you take any prescription medication, ask your pharmacist about interactions as well.)   Season 2 of the Podcast ‚ÄúThe Dream‚Äù is about the wellness industry and they touch a lot on the history of supplements in the US. In particular, I think it‚Äôs episode four that details why they‚Äôre so unregulated. (The industry spent millions on lobbying.)
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Hello, medically speaking most supplements dont work and increase in performance is more linked to the placebo effects (there is a lot of research on this freely available) or they are packed with copious amounts of caffeine or other stimulants. But at that point the 'supplement' is a drug.   Assuming you have the money, it would be better to buy the food for your health needs. And if you aren't doing so i recommend 30-60 mins of cardiovascular activity a day. It energizes your body and gives you alot of mental clarity.  Granted this activity should be an easy ish pace not to tire you out.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,If you can, get a physical done to see what deficiencies you have.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Does protein powder count as supplements? Have been just trying to get swole lol
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I take multivitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, fish oil, and zinc daily. I‚Äôve been taking Multivitamins, and fish oil (on and off) since middle school give or take. Started taking vitamin C freshman year as I got the flu at least 3 times that year and my doctor recommended it to boost my immune system. I started taking vitamin D this year as I‚Äôm not going outside as much as I do and Michigan already lacks the sunlight my body is accustomed to taking. I utilize yearly checkups my insurance provides to make sure I‚Äôm not overtaking or undertaking anything which is extremely possible with supplements, I also run everything I‚Äôm taking by a doctor relative to make sure I‚Äôm not taking something harmful (sort of a quick litmus test to weed out edge cases). I strongly suggest asking a doctor  about supplements whenever possible, even when taking generic, OTC supplements like multivitamins and vitamin C. If you are talking about ‚Äúacademic supplements‚Äù, which are controlled substances btw, I‚Äôd caution against their use as I saw a decent chunk of my friends try those and not obtain any benefit (they either worked hard for 8-10 hrs but crashed for the next 12+ hours or got hyper focused on random shit like draft projections and sports rankings for 2-3 hours instead of studying).
post,COVID-19,positive,If I mask a course (like math 316 Differential Equation) and end up going to some (other) grad school either master or PhD, can that be used as a prerequisite to classes?  Technically, it's def C- or above but still some schools might have used to require, say, C+ or above for their undergrad reprerequisite?  I suppose it's school-dependent, but I hope to hear some specific cases.
comment,COVID-19,positive,At least at Michigan in general graduate standing waives whatever undergraduate prereqs there are for a course, unless it‚Äôs like a 600 level class that has 500 level prereqs.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Really depends on program. When i applied to grad school some programs would take classes a b or better in core classes. Since i am engineering diff eq would be core. Other programs just take your average major classes gpa.   Keep in mind admissions are more interested in your junior and senior years. Assuming you have more course work years to do i think you'll be fine.
comment,COVID-19,negative,It'll depend on the program, most likely with more prestigious/rigorous programs expecting that you don't mask grades. If I were you, I would err on the side of caution and have the grade show unless the letter grade would be too detrimental to your overall GPA.

I've posted about this before on this sub; if you ever need someone to talk to, shoot me a dm and ill reply as soon as I can. Maintaining your sanity and health is more important than grades.

comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Take my upvote you goddamn relatable beauty
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I was actually just wondering when a thread like this would be made, been feeling like this lately. I‚Äôm graduating magna cum laude and I still feel like I don‚Äôt belong here and admissions made a mistake in accepting me. When my classmates are involved in project teams, being IAs, and doing research while all I do is go to class and do the bare minimum required of me as a student, it‚Äôs hard to not feel like someone else could‚Äôve made better a better use of my admission. But hey, at least there‚Äôs less than two months left of classes
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,If you got in you belong here! But imposter syndrome is very real. Just remember not everyone has it together, and you don‚Äôt have to have it all together to belong.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,lol I graduated from U-M several years ago with a decent gpa, now got a masters and have a great job. still feel like I wasn't good enough to go to u-m or get a good job. So, welcome to the club I guess?
post,Housing,positive,I am an autistic college student who was recently admitted to LSA for the fall semester as a transfer student. I was looking into housing options and filling out a disability support application and I saw an option to bring my emotional support animal and a section in housing about disability inclusive living situations. Does this mean either that all students with pets are housed together and/or that all students with disabilities are housed together?
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello,   I'm a CO 2025 admit into LSA. I just found out about the LSA honors program, and it seems really cool. I'm definitely tempted to apply. However, I also intend to transfer into engineering or Ross during my freshman or sophomore year. I was wondering whether being in LSA honors would bar me from doing that. I understand that I can't be in both programs, but I'm just not sure whether I can "\\leave"LSA honors to transfer. Thanks and go blue!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,You can call and ask LSA advisors or there are LSA cross campus transfer info sessions that you can attend.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,There is absolutely nothing barring you from transferring to either Ross or Engineering if you‚Äôre in LSA honors.   However, when applying to transfer to Ross, you will need to have completed a 1st year writing requirement course. As you probably already know, the Honors program will require you to complete an honors writing requirement (which will also fulfill the FYWR). So, just make sure to complete that honors FYWR in your first sem as a freshman since the honors program rarely offers any honors writing courses second semester, and you may be required to do a general LSA FYWR as well as an Honors FYWR if you wait until second semester and then apply to Ross and choose against it or do not get in.   This might seem a bit confusing, but feel free to PM me if you didn‚Äôt understand it!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I did the exact thing with engineering my second semester freshman year. If anything being in honors for that time allowed me into more available FYWR classes that still fill the CoE prerequisite, so I definitely thought it was worth it.

comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,Here's a newsflash for you: You *do* need therapy. You saying you "don't feel anything" about your mother's passing and your "no empathy" for your sister are huge red flags for me that you need to get professional help. I'm not saying this to be a dick, I'm saying this because you genuinely have issues you need to get worked out.

post,PSA,positive,Make sure it's freely accessible for all students regardless of department or put it on the syllabus ahead of time.  And don't tell me to log in through the physical Caen computers. If I have to come to school to do an assignment, that defeats the purpose of having a remote class.
comment,PSA,positive,There is a way to remote access caen computers from home. Information is [here](https://caen.engin.umich.edu/connect/), the least buggy way is to connect using VMware, which is free (follow the link for Windows Remote Desktop Service and it'll guide you through downloading and setting it up).  I hear you though, your professors absolutely should be telling you about all the resources available, so I'm sorry that you're having a rough time
comment,PSA,neutral,Caen is usually reserved for CoE students only? Are you an CoE student in a non CoE course or, are you saying your department doesn't have access to the program? Or maybe the program isn't available remotely?

post,Finances,positive,My situation this semester is that after financial aid, I have about $2k left that I owe the school. My scholarship is more than that amount, and it covered the remaining cost I owed. However, later the school reduced my Provost by the amount of the scholarship.   Is there any way to use the scholarship to cover my owed cost without my aid being reduced. Currently there is literally no point in having a scholarship if they're just going to take away my grant money.
comment,Finances,neutral,If your scholarship isn‚Äôt from the university, you could try to get them to make it out to you. Then you just cash it and it‚Äôs money in your bank, UM doesn‚Äôt reduce your financial aid if they never know about it.
comment,Finances,positive,Not easily. A scholarship essentially increases your efc so your need based aid goes down.

comment,Class,positive,how do you suggest the professors do this? (I am creating/teaching a course next semester, would defo love student feedback. back where I am from, we didn't have any homework, the exam was 100% of the grade).
comment,Class,positive,Generally you learn best if you practice something a little bit each day. Your brain analyzes, organizes, and cleans up things each night, so working each day maximizes that critical time.
comment,Class,positive,I agree. I'd rather just have one big homework obligation due at the end of each week. That way I can still 'fall behind' strategically and still make it up at the end of the week, and all the review material can be centralized in one place
post,Finances,positive,I have a tuition to cover my scholarship but UM isn‚Äôt giving me any grants to go towards housing ): I only have nearly 2k from the Federal Pell Grant which makes my remaining cost nearly as much as the cost of tuition. Has anyone asked for a reconsideration and been given it? I‚Äôm kind of disappointed right now
comment,Finances,positive,Are you already a student or an incoming freshman? If you're an incoming freshman, then I've heard of stories of people successfully getting more financial aid but I have no personal experience with this.   If you're already a student, then you might be able to request more financial aid if your family's income decreased in the 2020 tax year. I recently did this because my family's income decreased by $20,000 in 2020. The financial aid office increased my Pell Grant by $2,000 and even retroactively adjusted my Pell Grant from last semester so that was a total of about $4,000. They will also offer you more federal loans, so you can choose whether you want to take those or not. They will NOT increase any grants/scholarships you have (I have the Michigan Grant and Provost's Award) but they will give you the UM Emergency Grant if you are eligible for it. I believe the maximum you can get for the UM Emergency Grant is $5,000 a year. This may or may not apply to you but if you happen to be a CS-LSA student and receive the Provost's Award, then they might increase your Provost Award as well. For me, they recalculated my Provost Award because they were originally calculating it based on LSA tuition costs so they recalculated it based on COE tuition costs (bc CS-LSA students pay COE tuiton). This increased my Provost's Award by about $1,500 a semester.   If you need emergency funding to cover rent/food/basic necessities because of financial difficulties then the Dean of Students will offer up to $500 grants per yr and the CEW+ has some emergency funding too but I'm not sure what their maximum is.   I hope this helps!
comment,Finances,neutral,If they do, it'd probably be in the form of a federal loan, at least that's been my experience.
post,Class,positive,Any suggestions for something easy and fun? I'm looking to fulfill my humanities credit and want to take something that's actually interesting. Also don't want to have to do a ton of reading.

post,Degree,positive,Hi, I'm a prospective student having applied to UT at UM, any kind of input would be much appreciated. I saw their website and the one YouTube video they have about UT on their channel, besides that, there isn‚Äôt much to know about the major online, so any sort of input is welcome!
comment,Degree,positive,Huh, I'm looking at the sample schedule on [this page](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/degrees-certificates/bachelor-science-urban-technology) and I see three classes from my department listed, one of which I helped to student-teach. Between never meeting anyone who was in this program, having never heard of it before, and never had students that mentioned it, that gives me the vibe that this program is new, like, *really really new.* That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it might be hard to get personal perspective from someone in that program.  It looks pretty cool, seems spread sorta between Taubman (the architecture school), School of Infomation (the miscellaneous tech stuff and softcore/applied computer science and tech design school), and STAMPS (the art school), which on one end you can be like "oh, cool, balanced education, diverse perspectives and skillsets" and at the other end you can be like "oh, will I be solid enough in these skills to get whatever job I want postgrad," which probably isn't a judgement you need to make immediately anyway.  That said, it'd also get you sorta exposed to tech, design, and that urban-planning-kinda-stuff, and if you liked/hated any parts of it in practice you can always change majors to find something you vibe with more; a lot of people hope majors a time or two before they find their best fit. It seems cool, so I'd say go for it
comment,Degree,positive,You should consider getting a meeting with the program lead Bryan Norwood  I‚Äôm in taubman and I think the degree has a lot of great qualities. If it had existed when I was a freshman I may have done it. I‚Äôm taking 1 of the classes that will become a required one for the curriculum if you wanna ask me questions   I think the only thing that i find weird is the winter 22 start.

post,Class,positive,Okay y'all I did not work my ass off to NOT get a gaudy overpriced class ring, but I'm really having trouble finding one that I like. Any site / ring recommendations?  Second, I'm pretty cool-skinned and I hardly ever wear yellow gold,,, but since it's Michigan, I feel like I have to, with a blue gem if I get a stone. Thoughts / opinions? Also if you guys have a stone / cut you think would look best, name it!   Double also, if you have one I'd love to see pictures!!  Note: I definitely don't want to pay more than a grand and the cheaper the better but it's open to discussion if it's just absolutely amazing. I'll get a payment plan or something.  Thanks!  Edit: also what are some engraving ideas / quotes?
comment,Class,positive,Sorry man, older guy here, but experienced graduate. Save the cash, you'll wear it a year or two then put it in a box. Imagine wearing a variety jacket for 5 years after you graduate.....would you want people to see it? Season football or basketball tickets would be a much better investment!
comment,Class,positive,I have one. Mine has the subjects I studied on either side with my name engraved on the inside. It has a blue gem (whatever fake/artificial one was offered) with a silver M printed on, and is the stadium style set where the top of the ring goes in rather than out. It was a graduation gift from my parents and grandma; I'm not sure if I would have bought one myself but I'm glad I have it.  I find myself a bit on both sides of what people are saying here. The comment from u/EMU_FLYER about how often I wear it definitely rings (hah) true. I wore it almost daily the first 2-3 years after graduating. I also at the time had a very public facing job at Michigan, so it felt even more appropriate. Ten years down the road I wear it on more 'special' Michigan occasions. A friend from college gets married, special event at work, football game, etc.   Meanwhile, my diploma is...I'm not actually sure where. Presumably in a padded envelope in our basement. A few of my colleagues have theirs framed in their offices, I have random campus pictures instead. I prefer those but people like what they like.   I will say that I've never given any thought to someone wearing one and what it might say about them. It's also not something I'd really pay any attention to.
comment,Class,positive,Well I'm sorry but I have no suggestions on where to get one BUT Idk if you might like this quote/motto that Michigan always uses: "Those who stay will be Champions." I personally really like it so maybe you'll like it as an engraving on your ring! Goodluck!
comment,Class,neutral,I got my high school class ring at Walmart and it looks identical to whatever partner company my High school was working with  So I‚Äôd suggest you shop around if you actually want it.

post,Health / Wellness,negative,There was a post made recently [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lmcym3/i_got_rejected_from_um_phd_program_and_i_was/) about being admitted to a psych ward posted the day I was discharged from another psych ward. After seeing this post after I left, I have been meaning to post about my  experience  as well but I am still quite shaken about it and only now have the courage to do so. Hopefully talking about it helps.  I am currently an undergrad in UofM and I have been dealing with depression for quick some time now. I have been trying to get my life back on track and I think it was going well. I have recently been talking to a therapist and they recommended me to talk to my primary care physician about taking anti-depressants and that's how this all started. To be clear, I am not suicidal and at the very worst, serverely depressed with an idealization of suicide. I have never hurt myself or others nor plan to.  I made an appointment to my PCP that I have been seeing since I was a child which was not a good idea in hindsight. They specialize in family care and were just unprepared for what I was asking of them. When I had told them about my depression, they had me stay in the room as they called the hospital to get me transferred. I had to get escorted by police because they did not trust me to get there on my own.   Once I arrived, I had to wait to get admitted for about 2 hours because they were so busy. When I actually did get admitted, I had to give them everything and wait for a psychiatrist to come evaluate me. That took another couple hours. When they finally came, they asked me a couple of questions that lasted about 3 minutes. The questions were things like "How long have you been depressed?" "Do you think about killing yourself?" "How would you do it?" I answered truthfully but I really wish I didn't. I had told them 3 years, yes, and I guess I would go into a closed garage with my car running. After this, they left for another couple of hours. I kept on asking what was happening and when I could go. The nurses said I had to keep waiting for the psychiatrist. After many hours they came back and said I had to stay as I was deemed a risk to myself and others. Unfortunately, my insurance didn't cover this hospital so they were trying to transfer me to somewhere else that would. They had no idea how long this would take so I was just forced to wait. It took 3 days. 3 Days of nothing but just laying in a bed while someone watched me, making sure I don't do anything. I felt myself going insane, just trying to make the time go by. I was given only a word search and an xbox with no games (so useless) on the second day and finally a book and a switch with an actual game on the third day but only hours before I left. At this point, my anxiety was sky high and was shaking at the fear of staying any longer. I felt so relieved getting transfered, just hoping I can go back home later that day.  I was driven to a holding ground of sorts, where they evaluate you before sending you to another hospital. I was really hoping I could convince them I was not a danger and to let me go with what I originally wanted, some medication. I was allowed my stuff back so I was getting in contact with my family  and updating them on what was happening and my plans on leaving. After talking to the staff, I figured out why I was not allowed to leave. The psychiatrist that had seen me for 3 minutes had concluded that I was suicidal with the intent to asphyxia myself. They had concluded that I am unwell and can no longer make medical decisions for myself. I was told if the doctor in the new facility did not agree, I could have them override the decision and let me go. I talked to the doctor, told them my situation, and was confident that I would be let go. After some time, I ask the staff what the decision was. It was for me to get hospitalized again. I pleaded to talk to the doctor again and kept asking all the staff what I could do. It was already around 8pm and they had said I was the last to see the doctor for the day. They said it was a close decision but the doctor ultimately listened to the previous doctors recommendation. I kept asking about other options, about my rights, about  involuntary stay and so on. I was basically told that I have no rights and there was nothing I could do.  I knew for a fact that I had rights but I didn't know what they were. After a while, I was pulled aside by one of the staff and was told to basically stop being difficult and that there was nothing I could do but accept it. At this point, I was so full of anxiety, fear, and rage. I felt like I was just being ignored and that the staff didn't give a single shit about me. They just wanted me to shut up and go with it. I really melt down after this.  This is when I was finally admitted to a psych ward at 2am. I still hadn't given up and kept asking everyone there what my options are. The nurse there straight up told me that there was really nothing I could do, and the best thing I could do was just go with it as well. They said if I act out, they would keep me there. If I don't take the meds that they prescribe, they would keep me there. If I try to take the legal route, they would keep me there. There was nothing but try to act as normal as possible and be discharged in another 5-7 days. I thought I could maybe go through the legal route but after asking about a ITT (intent to terminate treatment) form, I was immediately threatened by a nurse to sign another involuntary admission form which would force me to stay at least 3 more days. I had given up hope and just wished I could just escape to my friends and family. The doctors there were also no help. When meeting with one, he first talked about another patient in front of me in closed doors to another colleague but I guess I could listen. When he finished, he had asked me if I was korean or chinese or what? I answered chinese american and he proceeded to go off on china, assuming I would be fine with it because I was american. He made comments such as "Chinese health care is one bullet to the head" and so on. I could do nothing but agree and nod. This doctor was in control of the meds I was being forced to take or else I would be there forever. For the rest of the days, I was just trying to seem as sane as possible while shaking with anxiety, with the most fear I have ever felt in my life, and with nothing but a wall phone to connect me to the outside world.   When I was finally discharged, I had just sped through everything, saying I was perfectly fine, that I improved and am all better. In reality, I never felt so much anxiety, I have never felt so much fear, and I have never been so fucked up. They had told me to continue with the medication but I realize after that they never asked for my pharmacy nor gave me a prescription. I was discharged feeling far worse than I ever have before and with no meds that I was trying to get in the first place. It has been a week and I still get anxiety attacks that I have never had before, I keep waking up from nightmares about being kept there forever. I was trying to get better but was left with all this, no meds, and a huge distrust of the health industry. I haven't been able to even look at school work since then and I don't know what to do now. I just hope I will get better but I know it won't be any time soon now.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I am so so sorry this all happened to you. You sound like an incredibly strong person and I really hope things get better for you
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,This sounds like a fucking never-ending nightmare.  I've felt suicidal before and I'm currently depressed but if this is what people who go to the psych have to deal with, I'd rather die before police arrive. Thank god U-M has finally realized that bringing the fucking cops and putting you in psych jail isn't the best way to go.  This is inhumane. I'm sickened. Thank goodness you made it out okay.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I'm sorry you went through that. It's absolutely horrific.  Are you able to talk with a trusted friend or family member you wanted to? Your distrust of medical professionals is warranted given the trauma you were put through, and I can imagine how much you might want to just be heard right now.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,First of all, like so many others, I am so sorry you went through this!!  It is a horrible, traumatic story. I went through something similar with my son at another university, but we were able to extract him fairly quickly because we had medical power of attorney forms filled out. FOR ANYONE READING THIS, having someone you trust explicitly with your life complete medical power of attorney forms could save you from this horror! You can get them so that they only go into effect if you are unable to make your own decisions concerning your care. Like this case, or if you are in a coma or something. If you are married, your spouse will have it automatically, but being a single adult, the decisions just go right to the dr, otherwise.  Ok, now...PLEASE take care of yourself. Take baby steps. Seek out things which remind you what it feels like to be happy. Be gentle with your self-talk. Acknowledge great and good things about yourself. Be careful what you expose yourself to (media-wise, people around you, etc). Eat well. Exercise. Practice gratitude. Perhaps journal. Meditate. Get outside. Take a term off if you need to. Stay busy with healthy things.  You are part of all of us. We see you and hear you. You are nit alone. Love yourself first. The rest will follow.  You are beautiful and good.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,This is one of my worst nightmares and I am beyond appalled and scared that this kind of thing still happens. I‚Äôm so sorry. Have you ever thought of going more public with the story or sueing them for abuse. The fact that someone else here had a similarly traumatic experience makes me think this is common. Some of the things they did and the way they manipulated you seem to be definitely abusive (of course the whole thing was abusive, but people could just say they‚Äôre doing their jobs).
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Involuntary treatment is a fucking Orwellian terror. CS Lewis proved right again:   ‚ÄúOf all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.‚Äù
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I‚Äôm so sorry that you had to go through all of that. I was involuntarily admitted into the psych ward at UM my sophomore year. It‚Äôs a pretty traumatic experience, so I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I hope things start to improve for you soon.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Does anyone know how you are supposed to fight wrongfully being forced into a psych ward? Like, if there were a lawyer in a psych ward, what would they say/do from a legal standpoint to get themselves out?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thank you for sharing your story, what a terrible (and totally unnecessary) experience. As someone who wants to work in psychiatry someday, and also struggles with mental health, I'm hoping a change is gonna come. It might not be soon, but someday.  Good to know how UofM "takes care" of their people. üôÑ  I don't know if this resource will be helpful but auntbertha.com has a lot of info for different types of support in your local area (they only need a zip code). I hope you're able to find the help you need. üñ§
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I honestly don‚Äôt think I have ever heard a story describing a positive experience with emergency psych. Not just at UM, but anywhere. What happened to you is disgusting but hopefully you learned a valuable lesson about being candid and honest in front of authority figures who shouldn‚Äôt be trusted. So many systems which operate under the guise of protecting us, like healthcare and criminal justice, actually just punish our honesty.  Also, I‚Äôm noting that both you and the other poster are non-white (or at least I‚Äôm assuming the other poster isn‚Äôt, given the Visa issue). I would not be surprised at all if there is an element of systemic racism at play which explains why you guys both had particularly terrible experiences.

post,COVID-19,positive,I was recently accepted to a PhD program at Michigan!  I think I will accept the offer, which means I probably need to find housing very soon. What do you think of your chances of being back in-person this fall? Did a lot of people stay on campus despite online/hybrid classes? I am considering whether I should wait until we get official notification and risk having few options or sign a lease early when I'd rather just live at home.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I‚Äôm joining the economics PhD program so the most I need is a computer from what I can tell. I also would rather not miss out on the social scene, if any
comment,COVID-19,positive,Personally everyone I know getting a PHD has been back on campus   You didn‚Äôt indicate what you‚Äôre getting a PHD in but my engineering friends have been back in their wet labs since July  My friends whose PHD requires more reading/writing still utilize the library (for physical books) and other department resources   Last comment, what time zone are you in? Not being in eastern time while being remote is hard. So if you‚Äôre in a different time zone that alone is a worth while consideration for moving
comment,COVID-19,positive,Congrats on your admission!  Nobody knows for sure what fall semester is going to look like yet. I try to avoid making predictions, but research credit-hours in my department this term were listed as ‚Äúin-person‚Äù, meaning any student registered (e.g. all PhD students) is required to participate in the on-campus testing program unless granted exemption, even though we are all working from home. More broadly, the university has been ramping up in-person research, so people working in wet labs or with specialized equipment are all back now, albeit with restrictions on density in shared spaces.  With that in mind and considering the university will certainly have a robust vaccination program in place by next fall, I‚Äôd definitely be planning to live in Ann Arbor (damn, it‚Äôs so hard to avoid making predictions, lol).
comment,COVID-19,positive,I think this will come down to the department's recommendation. I know some people who moved out to grad school without a social network for Fall 2020 and they're not too happy ‚Äì¬†even in NYC, Seattle, etc. Ty for the insight everyone!
comment,COVID-19,positive,Congrats! Still waiting on my decision, but I‚Äôm an undergrad here right now. All of the graduate students I know are still staying in Ann Arbor. For some students I know it would be impossible to do their research remotely, but others it is possible, so it really depends on your area. Even the people I know doing simulations and stuff that can be done remotely still are here and go onto campus sometimes though. I‚Äôd try to find a place now if I were you.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I'd also recommend looking for a place to live in AA. The only reason to not look for a place in AA would be if the alternative is a really good one (if you really like where you are living right now and would enjoy living there next year). But if your alternative to AA is not that awesome, look for an AA lease!
comment,COVID-19,positive,Amazing! A lot of people are on campus, and I think it is likely we'll be shifting to more in-person activities. Also as a grad student, you can't really do research without being on campus.    I would recommend waiting to sign a lease, until you're more sure of what you want. The Ann Arbor housing market is a bitch, so do your research on which landlords and areas are generally the best to live for the price - I know a lot of areas down Packard tend to be cheaper than close to the Diag, and as a grad student, the proximity to the diag is generally less of a draw. There is always housing available, even last minute, and at the worst you can sublet places until you figure out a more permanent lease.   Personally, I feel like you should prepare for a move to campus (the pros generally outweigh the cons), but hold off on investing yourself in the market until you're sure of your financial and personal situation.
comment,COVID-19,negative,Don't sign a lease until you know whether classes are remote. I did as a new PhD student, and it's one of the worst decisions I've made. Landlords in Ann Arbor are terrible.

post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Good afternoon Wolverines!!   I am curious how students feel about classes that hold evening exams (exams that are not scheduled during regular class time), particularly before COVID. What were some pros and cons? How did they make you feel? Do you think you did better or worse because they were later? Are you talking about a 6-8 PM exam or an 8-10 PM exam?    As for finals, what are some things you wish were different? Do you know your student rights in regards to exams? Do you know who to reach out to or where to go if you have questions about finals that you don‚Äôt want to ask your professors? I‚Äôm curious about both pre COVID and presently. I know special exams (combined exams for all sections of a particular course) can get a little crazy on top of having multiple daytime exams so if you‚Äôre speaking about a special exam, please include that.    Feel free to let it all out! Thank you in advance!
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,As a commuter student, evening exams were sort of something I had to plan a whole day around. It's not like I could go home or to my dorm for 4 hours before an exam, since I would have to commute back and forth again. I would mostly just spend all that time studying somewhere before the exam. It would be cool to be able to take those exams during class time, but I understand that isn't feasible when class is only 50 minutes and most exams are much longer
post,Buy / Sell,positive,Hey I am looking a private tutor for EECS 376. Preferably someone who took an A in this class. If you are interested DM me with your rate and availability.
post,PSA,positive,I just got an email prompting me to leave mid-term evals so I thought I might remind everyone else while I do mine.  This is much more important and helpful, than you expect, for both your instructors and you. I‚Äôve TA-ed as an undergraduate before and my biggest regret is not asking my peers to leave evals for me (only got about 40% evals). Both positive and negative evals are equally helpful.
comment,PSA,positive,AFAIK, the midterm evaluations only go to the instructors; the idea is to give some feedback that may be useful to tweak some aspects of the course for the rest of the term. The numerical portion of the final evaluations are accessible to the administrators (department chairs, etc.), so when the instructor is gong through a review of any kind ‚Äî a regular annual review, or tenure or promotion review ‚Äî they are included in the paperwork.  I don‚Äôt know for sure if text answers are accessible to the administrators, and if they are, how much scrutiny they get at that level, but the instructors definitely read those.
comment,PSA,positive,I‚Äôve always wondered, where do these evals actually go? I know they go to the person being evaluated but do they go to superiors or anything else? Like, it seems like negative feedback for higher level professors would kinda fall on deaf ears if it didn‚Äôt go any higher
post,Housing,positive,How often are they? I know Covid will make it different, but it looks like things will be more normal in the fall.  &#x200B;  Is it hard to sleep when they are going on? I sleep at 12 or 1AM on a Friday night, I am close to deaf without my hearing aid, but if you have vibrations / loud sounds, it might still be hard.  &#x200B;  Also, is there pressure to party? I heard that might be an issue at some houses? I imagine partying some but there'll be days I'm not into the idea.  &#x200B;  Thank you in  advance.
comment,Housing,positive,nakamura normally hosts open mic nights from like 8-11 pm every other thursday, and like 1-2 open parties a semester, with 1 in house prog a semester in a normal year? of course that can change (edit which is what i‚Äôd say moderate?)   i say there isn‚Äôt pressure but easy access so if you want to , it‚Äôs very easy to. most coops respect week day quiet hours well, i haven‚Äôt heard anything from friends in nak on an issue sleeping   you can contact current house members via their instagram or the pres email for more accurate info than reddit!
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Basically I've been experiencing regular bodily tremors (suspected to be anxiety-inducing) in all kinds of scenarios: right before taking a test, right before unmuting mic to speak in class, when an idea hits me and I get excited to share it or speak about it, etc. This doesn't seem normal, and the tremors stop after a few minutes, but I thought it'd be good to speak with a professional about this.  How secret is booking a counseling appointment? I mean you still register with all of your personal details and your email, and I am assuming they now send you an email invite with an online meeting link (so ultimately there is still the email record on their end), but I am curious how this personal information and record is handled by them, if anyone knows? And how long do they retain this information for?  Sorry if I seem paranoid. I hope some of you can share some of your insights, thanks.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,They have a statement on confidentiality [here](https://caps.umich.edu/content/confidentiality). Not too well versed in it, but I'm pretty sure any of that information is protected under HIPAA. They aggregate statistics it seems, but actually sharing personal information anywhere outside of who needs to know about it is something you're legally protected from.
post,Employment,positive,Hello,   I am a Ross/CS dual-degree looking to pursue IB/VC short term, then do an MBA and MS in data science, and finally transition into tech.   I recently took my first EECS 203 midterm and am not feeling so confident about my grade. Would it look bad to MBA/Data Science programs and employers if I made 203 P/F and got all As in my 5 other classes? Could I use Covid as an excuse even though I was able to perform well in my 5 other classes this semester?   For context, I would make any grade below an A- a P/F (B+ or lower). Thank you!
comment,Employment,positive,Bro it's 1 class no one's going to care
comment,Employment,positive,I'm also a Ross CS duel degree (current sophomore) and can confidently say your GPA is going to be fine if that's what your concerned about. CS classes are like 100x Harder (1 281 project = 3 ross classes ) and Ross classes are 100x easier, so your GPA will balance out to a normal level. Don't worry too much about it tho, for internships most places don't care as long as you aren't disgustingly failing your classes (anything above like a 2.5 is fine).

post,Housing,positive,As title suggests, I am a second year student and I spent my first year remotely for budget and covid safety concerns(my family member is among high risk group). However, I feel like I missed a lot of community aspects of dorm life that is  usually afforded to new student and I am looking for suggestions about on or near campus housings that also foster a sense of community for next academic year.
comment,Housing,neutral,The second year experience at Stockwell is probably going to have what you‚Äôre looking for.
comment,Housing,positive,If not stockwell (sophomore dorm on campus) consider the co-ops You‚Äôll get a similar experience to a dorm by living with a lot of people and if I recall correctly the co-ops usually have like a sense of identity to each.  I‚Äôm sure someone else could speak to them more but I think they‚Äôd be a good option for you

post,Prospective Student,positive,I am a student who are looking forward to transfer to umich CoE.  On the website it says that umich don't accept any placement test administered by any institution and accept only courses taken by letter grade. Does it mean that ap credits cannot be accepted as prerequisite course??
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It means just bc your first institution gave you credit via AP or a placement test or something, doesn‚Äôt mean that UM will. Credits will be given for AP classes by UM‚Äôs standards, which may differ from your current school‚Äôs standards
comment,Prospective Student,positive,AP credits can be accepted as a pre req course but check on the AP-umich equivalency page first
post,Prospective Student,positive,I have been admitted in UofM, Ann arbor for MS in EECS( IC and VLSI) track for Fall 21. I am interested mainly in frontend vlsi i.e Computer Architecture, design, verification.   Can somebody suggest me what are the courses that I should/must take for frontend vlsi at umich ? and also how is the University overall for IC and VLSI track and in general?   Thanks in advance :-)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,U of M is definitely a top tier computer architecture/VLSI school, so you are in the right place.  For computer architecture, EECS 470 (computer architcture) and 570 (parallel computer architecture) are definitely must-take courses. 573 (microarchitecture) would probably fall into that category as well.  For the more traditional VLSI side of things, EECS 427 and 627 (VLSI design 1 and 2) are the core classes. I'm not sure whether those would be considered frontend, backend or a mix of the two.  The [ECE Grad Course List](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/graduate-course-list/) is probably your best resource from there. That page also has a link to the EECS course bulletin, which has some more detailed descriptions of courses.
post,Degree,negative,So I need to drop a class because I was a dumbass and didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to it thinking I would prioritize my major and take said class PF for the ‚Äúskillet‚Äù.   This whole time, I thought withdrawing would be no problem this semester, but I just double checked the umich website and it says that Ws DO appear on unofficial transcripts? So if I send my transcript with an internship application, they‚Äôll see I dropped this class? Is there any way to somehow remove that from the unofficial transcript or am I basically screwed here?
comment,Degree,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Degree,neutral,I'm gonna echo what's been said, just send in your official transcript if you're ever asked for a transcript.
comment,Degree,negative,I wouldn‚Äôt stress about it I got into grad school and had multiple internships with 2 Ws on my transcript
comment,Degree,neutral,You can download a PDF of your official to get around this.  Send it to yourself.
comment,Degree,neutral,I got into grad school with several W‚Äôs in my past. They were for health reasons, but they‚Äôre not marked like that. In my experience a W really isn‚Äôt a negative. Most people assume you had something else going on and needed to prioritize. You get credit for taking the W instead of taking a semester of C‚Äôs.
post,PSA,positive,I‚Äôm a photographer, and times are tough right now. So calling out to seniors who are looking to take some senior photos.   No catch, I‚Äôll do y‚Äôall a favor this semester.
post,Prospective Student,neutral,When I look at it on google maps it‚Äôs hard to tell when the campus ends and the town starts, so is it fairly integrated or can you really tell when you‚Äôre on campus vs in the town
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a bit of both actually. For the most part when you are in Ann Arbor you can easily determine whether you are on or off campus and campus is mostly in one part of the city. However, going on/off campus can be as simple as crossing a street or walking past a few more buildings. This is different from many other schools (such as MSU) where you can physically drive on and off campus.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Central campus is nicely blended with the rest of the city, as others said. I mean you can tell the borders, one block or side of the street has university style buildings with blue signs in front of each one, and the next has coffee shops and barbers and what not, but you never get the sense that you're passing through some entrance between the city and the campus. Some universities feel almost like walled, gated communities that way. The public cuts across the diag (diagonal walkways across the central block) just like students do. There are also some blurred lines, as U-M owns some buildings a few blocks from central campus, that are in otherwise retail or residential neighborhoods.  There are a few exceptions within the U of M. North campus, as opposed to central campus, has firmly differentiated borders. It's mostly bounded by busy streets, with a small number of roads leading into the campus. That's where the engineering school, music school, and art school are based. The athletic campus southwest of central campus has some large bricked off areas, so it's not as seamlessly integrated with the city as central campus, although I think a lot of that is to protect outdoor fields from the unauthorized trespassing.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Both? Campus butts up to downtown Ann Arbor Pretty much all the campus buildings connect by university property on central and north, respectively.   And there‚Äôs plenty of Ann Arbor that‚Äôs not the university
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Yes and no. We do have a central quad (the Diag) like most colleges and some other areas (Law Quad), but you won‚Äôt find a clear, distinct line between the college and the town like Stanford or even Harvard‚Äôs campus. It‚Äôs more like a gradual shift.  You may find this map depicting central campus helpful: https://imgur.com/a/RRTMcDi You can draw a box around the campus, but there are some shops and restaurants dispersed throughout the area, which I actually prefer to more closed-off campuses. But your mileage may vary.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I also heard you get shat on for trying to bike on campus is that true?
post,COVID-19,positive,Granted I got lucky that it fell on my busiest days of classes but man I really just needed an easy day
comment,COVID-19,positive,I think the wellness day is going to be helpful for most students in some way or another. For many it will be a day of rest/light work and many others a day to catch up without falling further behind. However, I think the prevailing sentiment is that the two wellness days we are being given this semester are supposed to be a replacement for spring break. Most students typically have very little to no work at all during spring break and have a full 10 days to relax mid semester. With these wellness days this isn‚Äôt the case as they come midweek during an already condensed semester and many classes are supplementing work before or after the break to account for the missed day. Well I‚Äôm appreciative I have no class tomorrow I‚Äôd probably prefer to have class tomorrow and spring break in a week or two.  I will add that I understand the purpose of the cancellation of spring break and giving us these days midweek as an alternative but it still doesn‚Äôt do as much in terms of the wellness benefits in comparison to a full week without classes.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I think they wouldve avoided a lot of problems by calling it a ‚Äústudy day‚Äù instead of a wellness day lol
comment,COVID-19,negative,They suck ass cause their midweek, I wish they would have made them into 3 day weekends
comment,COVID-19,neutral,It‚Äôs better than the other unpopular opinion that just said the Wednesday is horrible day for it
comment,COVID-19,positive,Yeah. The one good thing that will be coming out of tomorrow for me is that my alarm will not be set for any time.
comment,COVID-19,negative,You don‚Äôt have any tests to study for, essays to write, or homework to do?  I envy you.
post,Class,positive,welp, didn't manage my time correctly and I bombed the shit out of the free response. But at least I get a whole day free tomorrow‚Ä¶ to catch up on work from other classes! yayyyy!!!!!
comment,Class,positive,I also bombed the free response and I will also be catching up on more work tomorrow ;)  But at least you won‚Äôt be alone in that lol
comment,Class,negative,I bombed the whole thing. I feel bad after trying so hard on the homework and doing quite well on that. Not my worst exam ever though. I think I got like a 37% on an Orgo II exam and still passed.  Welp. Time to catch up on reading and homework.
comment,Class,negative,I noticed 2 big mistakes the SECOND after I submitted  :( im also worried their gonna mess up the grading bc i used 2 pages for one question and they said to leave a note if u do this and i didnt üò¨
comment,Class,neutral,Honestly, I can put up with a lot of crappy things about this class, but the fact that the lecture on the morning of the day of the exam is still covering stuff unrelated to the exam is simply beyond me. How are you not supposed to skip such a lecture anyways?
post,Class,neutral,Is bio 172 harder online than it is in-person?
comment,Class,positive,Took 172 in fall 20. They posted some practice questions from previous years and I can definitely say that the exams were harder online. However, it was all open notes (at least when I took it) so you really didn‚Äôt have to memorize a ton like you would have normally had to.  Taking 173 right now and from what I‚Äôve seen so far it seems to be much easier online

comment,Employment,positive,I feel like most campus jobs would be cool with that. MDining and RecSports both had pretty low minimums and let you swap shifts with other student employees as needed.
comment,Employment,positive,One I really rec is working for Housing. If you apply to be a CCA // Community Center Assistant you basically just work the front desk of a dorm, answer questions if they come up, print replacement or temp room keys, and check in packages/mail. Super easy and it‚Äôs totally fine to do homework on the job as long as you‚Äôre not neglecting those duties. So chill.

post,Prospective Student,positive,So I‚Äôm an incoming freshman and I was wondering if it would be smart/doable if I were to take gen bio and gen chem in the same semester? I plan on being premed, and I‚Äôd like to get some prereqs out of the way. I was also thinking of taking a math like stats or calc.  Any advice would be appreciated. I‚Äôm kind of in the dark when it comes to class scheduling.   Thanks all!  EDIT: would I also be taking labs with them too?
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,College labs are so time consuming They‚Äôre basically an additional class
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Gen chem has a lab with it, which is also relatively time consuming. For the two intro bio courses you take one alone first and then the second you take with a lab. You‚Äôre probably gonna wanna take Calc your first semester. I don‚Äôt know all of how LSA works but you‚Äôll have writing/language/seminar classes to content with also. I would not take calc, chem, chem lab, bio, and more classes all together, that will totally floor you when it‚Äôs your first semester at college.   Again I‚Äôm not totally sure how premed and LSA work exactly, but I would guess you‚Äôll end up taking calc 1 or 2, gen chem, gen chem lab, and probably 1-2 courses for LSA core requirements.  When you go to orientation you‚Äôll have an advisor go over it with you, you basically don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúchoice‚Äù the first semester (although you technically do), in that the first semester classes doesn‚Äôt differ much for most students at least in STEM.   Note: I have taken Bio 172 and it will help a LOT if you take gen chem first, imo  Anyone else, please feel free to correct me or add anything to this :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I would recommend taking one of the two into bio classes, bio 171 might be a little easier, along with an easier math like stats 250. You might also consider taking bio 173 (the lab class) but you could also take that later. The overall idea, which was already mentioned, is to just take it relatively easy first semester. The transition can be a little tricky so you don‚Äôt wanna like stuff on. Just take it slow!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Ahhh, I started off my freshman year with taking gen chem and bio and decided to drop chem - it was a really good decision for me, just about saved my mental health! I'm sure it depends on how well versed you are in the subjects and how much time you want to put into each/what grade you're willing to get for them.   If you want to do it just to try it out, it's totally okay to drop one before the drop date if you don't feel its working out. Bio 171 is generally a bit lighter than 172 is.  As you may have heard, Michigan math is really hard for a lot of people. It would be nice to get out of the way at the beginning, but there's no shame in taking it over the summer at a local community college if you're not taking an extensive math sequence :)   I think you typically have to take a lab with chem, but I didn't take a lab alongside my bio.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,One thing I'd like to add is that it can really be difficult to judge how much time you will have to dedicate to each class your first few semesters here.  For my first couple of semesters I took classes that required a lot more work than I was used to in high school, so I really struggled with them, whereas if I had tried to spread them out a little bit more I think I could have been much more successful.  I highly recommend keeping an open mind towards dropping one of the classes early on in the semester if the workload seems undoable, because when I was a freshman I never really considered that an option, and it definitely could have saved me some headache.  Best of luck to you!

post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,MSE220 professor recommends the best way to study is to use lecture notes, and prior homework‚Äôs.

So I‚Äôm thinking to prep just by reading the textbook and doing practice problems, but 4 days of that sounds rough. Any ideas to change up my study routine?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,When most professors say ‚Äúlecture notes,‚Äù they are typically referring to the notes the student took while attending (or, in the current times, watching) the lecture.

He will only test you on stuff in lecture though, if you didn't take notes the first time through watch the lectures again and do it this time.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I‚Äôm currently waiting for my application results (hopefully I pass!!) but I just have a question. I‚Äôm currently applying for an international studies major at LSA, but would it be possible for me to double major for Musical Theater on the following semester? Theater has always been my top one, but I didn‚Äôt know that the deadline for MT was Dec. 1, 5 days after I I decided to apply at umich.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Congrats on getting in! Double majoring through SMTD is definitely possible, however the Musical Theatre program is notoriously competitive‚Äîlikely the most competitive in the whole country. They generally don‚Äôt let any transfers in after their first semester has started, and the rigorous audition process is set to weed out literally thousands of applicants. If you‚Äôre looking for performance opportunities, definitely check out the Bachelor of Theatre Arts or different performing arts groups on campus (NERDS and Musket come to mind). The musical theatre program operates in a league entirely its own, and generally doesn‚Äôt let others in except for very special circumstances.

comment,Prospective Student,neutral,https://lsa.umich.edu/transfer/prospective-students.html  https://lsa.umich.edu/transfer/prospective-students/before-you-apply.html  > Map Your Transfer Plan.

comment,Prospective Student,positive,There's no pre-reqs, but the college of LSA does have some graduation requirements that are *separate but in addition to* core requirements for your degree. Things like calculus, writing class, american culture, foreign language, etc... Transfer students will often try to knock as many of these out as possible while at the community college.

I'm pretty certain that I want to pursue CS, but I had a doubt about the major declaring process. On [this](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/cse_guide.pdf) website, I see that these are the requirements:  >**Computer Science‚ÄîCollege of Engineering (CS-Eng) Declaration Requirements**   >   >To declare a major in CS-Eng, you must be a College of Engineering student and:    >   >(1) Have completed at least one full term at UM Ann Arbor    >   >(2) Have an overall UM GPA of 2.0 or better in courses taken at the UM Ann Arbor campus and be in good standing    >   >(3) Have completed or earned credit by exam or transfer for at least one course in each of these categories:    >   >a. Calculus (e.g. Math 115, 116 or 156)    >   >b. Calculus-based physics lectures (e.g. Physics 140 or 160) or chemistry lectures (e.g. Chem 130)    >   >c. Required engineering courses (Engr 100, 101, or 151)   However, in a lot of universities only the top x% of students are usually able to major in CS even after meeting all requirements because of how popular CS is. Is this the case at UMich too? If yes, if there a certain GPA cutoff or percentile that first year students usually need to score to get into CS?
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Nope, once you satisfy these requirements you're guaranteed entry into the major.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It's extremely simple to declare a CS major and there are no hard limits on the number of people who can do so. Pretty much anyone with the bare min reqs will get to declare. Unlike \*cough cough\* Cal
post,Housing,positive,Good apartments near U of Michigan?  Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm going to be starting dental school in Ann Arbor this June and am having trouble finding good apartments as I‚Äôm currently living in another state.  The two most important factors for me are price and proximity to the dental school. Has anyone had any good experiences/knows of good apts near Umich central campus?
comment,Housing,neutral,What‚Äôs your budget/do you want to live alone? Those will greatly effect your options   Also summer subleases are really common here. So you may have more housing options if you get a sublease for June - august and then start a year lease in September
comment,Housing,positive,Worth noting that every one of UM‚Äôs campus bus routes stops at the Central Campus Transit Center, which is right next to the dental school. Proximity to the building may be less important than you think, as those buses are free and run frequently
comment,Housing,neutral,Whats your budget?
post,Finances,positive,I was recently accepted to masters in ece program. I currently live in New York with my family so I will be an out of state resident. I have some questions on what I should do to afford the high tuition because I will not be taking any loans.  1. Can I qualify for in state tuition after going to umich for a year or two?   2. I have not accepted the offer yet but should I email graduate school to ask for a scholarship or a grant? I‚Äôm a low income resident who went to undergrad school with financial aid and federal grants. Maybe I should mention this in my email.  3. I heard becoming a TA or RA is very difficult since they prefer phd or undergrads and impossible for first semester. Should I email some professors to ask if I could get those positions even though I have not officially accepted the offer?
comment,Finances,positive,Not sure about 2 and 3, but for 1 you can only qualify if you are a permanent resident of Michigan. The registrar has a list of the criteria [here](https://ro.umich.edu/tuition-residency/residency) for how residency works for the university and who pays IS vs OOS.
comment,Finances,positive,In regards to number 3, departments are always looking for GSIs, and usually compensate them with a small salary plus full tuition (regardless of residency status) in exchange for like 10-15ish hours per week. I've heard of plenty of Master's students getting these positions, but you just have to know where to look.   Usually positions with the department itself are filled by current PhD students who need funding. For you, these would be for sophomore junior or senior level ECE courses. If you haven't heard anything about one of these positions being available to you, then you might want to reach out to some professors within the department to see if they are looking for teachers for next fall. It is likely though that they have their own PhD students who they prefer to take the role over a master's student. However, it is definitely not unheard of for a master's student to hold one.  The next and best stop for master students would be teaching classes under the general ENGIN banner. This includes ENGIN 101 (beginners coding in Matlab and C) and ENGIN 100 (intro to engineering, with different sections housed in different departments). Both of these courses are ALWAYS looking for GSIs, and their staffs are usually predominantly Master's students! If you have any experience in teaching, or a background in code, then you would probably do very well in the interview process. Primarily these staffs are made up exclusively of UM grad students who also did their undergrad there and learned of the opportunity from a teacher or friend. Students coming from other schools usually don't get the positions just because they don't know about them. If you are interested in teaching 101, you should definitely email Dr. Laura Alford (Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering) or James Juett (Computer Science Engineering) and just explain your situation and mention that you'd really like to be looped in on the initial email blast when interview sign ups get sent out. Interviews usually happen around April. For 100, there is a section usually housed in each department. If you see any that you think you'd be qualified for, you can always reach out to the professor that runs that class and see if they will be looking for hires in the future. Keep in mind though that 100 sections only run one semester per year, while 101 sections run both, so you might have more job security in 101.  Beyond that, I've heard of quite a few biomedical engineering students going to teach labs as GSIs in the Biology department with great success. Similarly, I hear the Math department is always looking for GSIs for Calc I and II, as those classes are taught in smaller sections to help freshmen adjust to college. I'm not sure where to go for these though.  I will say from personal experience that quite a few of my friends went on to do a masters in engineering and I only know one person who is paying for that out of pocket. The opportunities are most definitely there, and they don't discriminate by residency status!   Also at Michigan, you're definitely going to want to be looking for a GSI position. We don't really use the term TA in CoE, and an IA is most definitely not what you're looking for.
comment,Finances,positive,Congrats on your admission! If you haven't already definitely reach out to the ECE program staff with more specific questions. They'll probably have some other useful info to share (I do work with CoE grad students).  1) No  2) Never hurts to ask, but there is very little aid like that for CoE Master's students. There is some at the [CoE/Rackham level(note many have pretty specific criteria)](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/), and some departments also award fellowship funding in small amounts to Master's students. If ECE has internal funding you are likely already being considered by virtue of being admitted, but again it's worth asking to know if you have any options.  3) What you have heard is correct, I would probably say it isn't even worth your time emailing about GSI (Graduate Student Instructor) positions if you are an incoming student from another school. Not sure how ECE does it but many of those decisions tend to be centralized at the department level, taking faculty preference into account when possible. When I've seen Master's students from outside UM get GSI positions it is always in their second year.   The same goes for research positions. If a faculty member can have you work for free and just earn research credit, they will do that first before committing research dollars. The exception to this is usually if you are intending to do a PhD with them beyond your MSE, or if they have grant money that needs to be spent and no PhD student to put on the project.   Overall I always advise students coming to Michigan for a Master's to be prepared to pay the full cost of the degree. If you're able to swing teaching or research funding, or even some Rackham/CoE support, that's fantastic. But the reality is the overwhelming majority of students pay full freight.
comment,Finances,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Finances,positive,1. Most likely no.  2. Typically they send you grant/scholarship info with your offer, but its quite rare to get something from the department for a masters. I wouldn't expect any funding from the ECE department.  3. There are graduate student research assistants (GSRA), graduate student instructors (GSI), and instructional aides (IA). Only GSRA and GSI positions get the tuition waiver if you are over 25% appointment rate. IAs are only undergrads. Courses typically have set number of GSI and IA positions. The GSI positions typically go first to PhD students who lack funding, very few spots open up for master students. Also the hiring process for this starts pretty close to the start of the semester, so you might not even know if you got a GSI position until like 2 weeks before classes start. GSRAs are also mostly PhD students but you might have a better chance getting into someone's lab than getting a GSI position. But yeah it maybe hard to get into one if you haven't accepted the offer yet.
comment,Finances,neutral,You have to be living in Michigan with an address as a resident (license and all that) for, I think, 1 full year without going to school before you can qualify for in-state
post,COVID-19,neutral,I wanted to see if someone agreed with my somewhat unpopular opinion.   &#x200B;  The other day I  was talking to a classmate about the "wellness day" and I was contending that having the wellness day in the middle of the week is hardly a break especially when you have assignments due the next day, let alone a test like I do. I understand the argument that putting it on a weekend (Monday/Friday) would allow for more students to go home and then come back and risk spreading. However, the people who live close enough already go home anyways, and adding the one day would not permit an influx of students to go home to California, come back, and then spread covid. I am just frustrated that a professor schedules an exam after the wellness day and my "day off" this semester is going to be spent studying on the exam that was scheduled terribly.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I think this is a very popular opinion
comment,COVID-19,neutral,You can‚Äôt call it an unpopular opinion then say exactly what everyone else thinks
comment,COVID-19,positive,I agree, not a day off in the slightest, middle of the week? What a joke
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Relying on completely virtual and asynchronous classes to prevent people from traveling is laughable.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Bruh how is this an unpopular opinion
comment,COVID-19,positive,The ‚Äúto prevent travelling‚Äù excuse for not having a break is TOTAL BS. With everything online, I could easily be touring the world the whole semester while taking my classes as long as I have my laptop and some wifi. The way I see it, this is just another F you from the university.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,The problem is students are already going home and coming back since online classes means they won‚Äôt be missing class by going home for a 3 day ‚Äúweekend‚Äù (i.e. go home Thursday night, attend discussion sections asynchronously and return Sunday). A lot of my coworkers, especially those living in Michigan or bordering states, were already doing this last semester (and asking me to switch shifts). The issue is back during summer when covid was still pretty new and most of the world was under lockdown the university thought classes would mostly be hybrid during fall and winter and they would need an incentive to prevent students from traveling. But given that their mostly/somewhat hybrid plan failed and most classes are online, having no spring break is not that enticing for students to stay as students can simply take Thursday&Friday off (Friday is already a day mostly reserved for discussion sections rather than actual lectures) and make themselves a 5 day break (or alternatively take Monday&Friday off and have another 5 day weekend for the next wellness break). Although Spring break was removed temporarily with good intentions, it has done more harm than it repaired, at least for the mental health of students.
comment,COVID-19,positive,sure it‚Äôs nice that i don‚Äôt have to go to my classes on my busiest day of the week but those classes are still setting due dates for thursday and friday and now i can‚Äôt even ask questions or get help on wednesday. it‚Äôs more like a break for the professors
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Having a wellness day in the same week as 3 midterms defeats the entire purpose of having a day off. It's just gonna be used for studying.
comment,COVID-19,negative,Unpopular opinion: racism is bad
comment,COVID-19,positive,I don't understand any of their "people will travel" arguments. They kicked most everyone out of the dorms and they aren't responsible/liable for what people do in off campus housing so idk why they care. Plus we all mostly have online classes and can travel whenever lol. Makes no sense just put it on Friday/Monday or give us our spring break back once you knew you were completely shutting down second semester
post,Health / Wellness,positive,I love getting these ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to take a break from school‚Äù messages. ‚ÄúMental health is more important than school work so be sure to get some well deserved rest!‚Äù Yeah I‚Äôm going to take a whole day off so I can give a shitty presentation the next day and fail my exam the day after.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,One of my teachers was really great and gave us the whole week off, lol,   A different teacher said "Well, since we usually have hw due on Friday, I guess I'll have to just make the hw due on Wednesday" SMH
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Its the administration making crappy decisions. There was no need to cancel spring break and president's day. This whole semester seems cramped
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Sorry what is wellness day? Do you mean the university-wide catch-up-on-the-egregious-amount-of-homework-I‚Äôve-been-assigned Day?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Yep same here. Pardon my language but it was just such a fucking dumb decision to do this. Everyone is already at home. If they want to travel they can. Taking away spring break was pointless and it‚Äôs just gonna make everybody feel worse, more than likely. The concept of a wellness day makes sense but professors and other staff seem not to care so it really falls flat in terms of execution
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,If we all send an email to administration, we'd probs get our point across
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,same, i‚Äôm getting a take home exam on monday that i have to submit by wednesday as well as an assignment due on tuesday for another class. people are traveling either way so spring break shouldn‚Äôt have been canceled, but it is they should atleast work with the faculty and make sure students are actually getting a break on the wellness day
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,At least you get a day off lol.   I've been working 7 days a week out of a hotel since the 18th of last month, just realized it's midterms, and I don't get to go home until the 14th of next month. I'd love a day off to get caught up or sleep more than 5 hours a night.
post,Class,positive,So the prof sent an email saying we should look into this mini course to help learn study skills. Has anyone taken this course and can say if it actually helped them study and get better grades.
post,Class,positive,I've seen lots of valid complaints on this subreddit about the 100-200 level math courses, and wanted to tell everyone about an opportunity to have your voice heard in the math department. An undergrad advisory committee is being formed for the math department, and tomorrow night (Feb 23) at 10 pm Ann Arbor time there's a mass meeting for all those who are interested in it. The zoom link is [here](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/398182/assignments/syllabus). You can email the undergrad organizer of the committee, Faye Jackson, at [alephnil@umich.edu](mailto:alephnil@umich.edu) if you have questions.      You don't have to be a math major/minor to attend! This is for anyone who wants to improve the math department. In fact, the committee organizer specifically wants the committee to have some people who aren't math majors/minors, since so many students in the 100-200 courses are from other majors.
comment,Class,positive,Isn‚Äôt that the night of the math 115 exam? Interesting planning...
comment,Class,positive,Math Education at Michigan could be much better. The Honors Sequence for Calc I/II were fun, interactive, and very good for learning. You worked with your classmates in real time and the professor gave you a lot of 1 on 1. The class sizes were also super small (<15). But unless you're majoring/minoring in math it's not worth it to do the honor's route. It's way more of a time commitment, and I switched into 215 by Calc III.   The sad part is the alternative to honors' is getting plopped into a course with >100 students, cramped student help hours, and arguably ineffective labs.

post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm a Ross admit and might want to continue my German education from HS and get a minor or dual major in German (just for fun mostly). How hard are these courses? I know the German department is revered here so I'm kind of looking forward to that. Additionally I know that Ross requires some credits for a language anyway. will I be fluent most likely if a major in German? (I speak at probably a B1 level right now).
comment,Prospective Student,positive,> Will I be fluent most likely if a major in German?  As a long time language-learner and someone who took courses in 3 different languages at UofM, this is entirely up to you. Will you become fluent *just* by taking German for 8 semesters? (assuming you graduate in 4 years) No. I know many Spanish and Japanese majors who are nowhere close to being fluent. 1 hour classes twice a week are not enough to become fluent. College language courses are really a continuation of high school ones. You use textbooks that are structured the same way, you have vocabulary quizzes every chapter, and you do well on tests by basically just memorizing grammar patterns.  To become fluent means being consistent with immersing yourself in your target language. In other words, speaking German with Germans regularly, watching German TV or movies, doing a study abroad in Germany, etc. It takes a high level of effort to become fluent in any language. Getting a major in a language doesn't guarantee that.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,They take a decent amount of work, so you'll have to decide whether that's worth it alongside your primary major + social obligations.  Viel Gl√ºck\*
comment,Prospective Student,positive,One thing that is hard about double majoring in two different colleges is you need to fulfill ALL of BOTH colleges course requirements - it's not impossible, just hard. A minor would be a great way to study both if you'd rather focus your time on Ross classes. The German department at UMICH is absolutely awesome.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Like someone noted, doing a dual degree between Ross and LSA is super freaking hard. It's probably gonna take you five years unless you go really hard.   The difficulty of the classes varies by level (obviously), but every German class that I've taken here has been **such** a good experience, I totally recommend it. The teachers? Amazing.   The question of fluency completely depends on how into the German community you want to get here. There's so many resources/events/speaking parters available that it is totally possible to be fluent - I've heard of people who have never taken a German class before coming out pretty darn fluent after four years :) I know Ross is big on international exchanges, and if being fluent is your goal you should look into that!
post,Prospective Student,neutral,I‚Äôm gonna be a freshman at uofm next year, and I need some advice as I‚Äôm signing up for AP testing. I was accepted LSA and also just got into Ross, and I was wondering if there are any classes that are crazy hard at mich that you would recommend trying to get credit for in high school. I‚Äôve been told that calc was really difficult so I‚Äôm already planning on taking the BC test, but are there any other classes that I should look into getting out of?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The AP English tests are pointless. You could take the AP chem exam and place out of Chem 130 but you can also do that with a placement exam upon entering. If you‚Äôre planning on doing LSA, I‚Äôd recommend doing AP calc exam and placing out of chem and foreign language requirements (either AP or placement)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Ross requires you to take a math class in college so even if you place out of Calc 1 or 2 you‚Äôd be required to do the next level here at mich or at a community college (which is prob easier). I took calc 1 here last semester and it took a lot of effort and time. Don‚Äôt know a ton about other classes but if there are some specific ones you are taking and want to know, lmk
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Didn't take 115 or 116, but tutored it and I must say 215>115 and 116 from what I can tell. Honestly the work in 115 and 116 looks like hell. As someone else mentioned, I think ross makes you take one calc class but IMO, if you even like math a little bit, calc 3 is worth it over 1&2. And Stokes' theorem is cool! ...right, guys?

post,COVID-19,neutral,All it did was push due dates up for me and make the preceding week more stressful. Thanks Schlissel
comment,COVID-19,positive,One of my classes halted all class activities for the week calling it wellness week instead of just the day. Thought it was really thoughtful of them especially because I didn‚Äôt feel a workload increase. Seems as if they accounted for the break within the syllabus as opposed to just shifting everything around it like most other classes.
comment,COVID-19,negative,All my classes are asynchronous and if I wanted a goddamn Wednesday off I can do that whenever. My classes have just shifted stuff around so the same amount of work is due, just none of it on Wednesday. I don't really blame them either, what are they sposed to do with a random Wednesday off?

post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm an incoming freshman (yay) and I have some questions about the gpa at UM. I've heard that there's deflation, is that true? I plan on majoring in biology with a pre-med track, so maintaining a high gpa is imperative. Have any current students noticed that it's hard to maintain a competitive gpa here? Also, any current pre-med students, how would you rate your premed experience (in respect to classes, gpa, social life, etc)?   Oh, and any general advice on what classes I should take first semester? I'd like to ease myself into the college experience and not overwhelm myself with tough classes right off the bat. Any class suggestions?  Any help is greatly appreciated!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Once you get ur unique name and password, you can look on atlas to see the grade distributions for the classes u have to take
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I can't speak to the pre-med track programs here as I'm in engineering, but from what I've seen, gpa deflation is not a thing (trust me, engineering tests are hard). Just like many other majors though, part of why UM is great is that it is very reputable, so a slightly worse gpa than expected can be made up for by the known rigor of the school.    In terms of overall first semester advice, I made the big mistake by getting a lot of harsh STEM classes out early, but don't do it! Take at least one chill distribution class that has nothing to do with science, it's a very refreshing break during crunch time for your harder classes
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I‚Äôm a current pre med student and no there is not grade deflation based off the classes I have taken. It‚Äôs not hard to get a high a gpa bc it‚Äôs based off you not others.
post,Degree,positive,I here a lot of good things about the German department but I was wondering what other languages have good departments to learn a language from scratch.
comment,Degree,positive,Some of the smaller languages can have scholarship opportunities  I had a friend take Russian and he got like a 5k scholarship   So poke around the language department websites to see if anything like that is currently available
comment,Degree,positive,There's a program called Residential College where the foreign language programs really excel. Instead of your usual language learning classes, you get put into intensive programs I and II and they are pass fail. If you took some languages in high school but are a bit rusty, the I intensive programs are a good start, if you are starting from scratch, the Winter Semester I program is built just for that. Some languages such as Japanese I believe you have to start from scratch anyways. The languages offered are limited though to French, Spanish, German and Japanese. Also it's like 8 credits (10 for japanese) each semester, but you can easily get a minor if you complete the sequence. Personally I'm taking French right now and am loving it :) Of course, the regular LSA has more language options which are also great.
comment,Degree,positive,I have had pretty good experiences with the Arabic department so far. I have had three different professors and GSIs, and they have all been great. It is a significant amount of work, but the department is pretty great, in my opinion.
comment,Degree,positive,Arabic is awesome and you have a really good opportunity to learn and practice with a lot people in southeast Michigan
comment,Degree,neutral,Definitely Japanese! Lots of cool opportunities, inclusing a once or twice a month social event where you eat sushi and shoot the shit in Japanese with people.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I transferred to umich this semester as a sophomore from another university where I majored in CS. After a few weeks in EECS 280, I decided that i won‚Äôt enjoy these EECS classes so I picked up interest with the BSI program.  I already missed the app deadline for the fall semester but I‚Äôm still planning to apply as soon as I can. I just wanted to know how difficult it is to get in and if you guys have any advice, sample essays, or info about your journey that you can share with me. I have all but 1 prerequisite (SI 110) which I plan to take over the summer. I‚Äôm wondering if it would‚Äôve been better to stay at my previous university for an extra semester and apply to the BSI program directly.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,~33% acceptance rate  Talk about why you want to go in (probably don‚Äôt say because eecs is too hard)  Go beyond the prerequisites and take as many si classes as you can before applying next year
comment,Prospective Student,positive,BSI junior here! Finish the prereqs as soon as you can, and see if you can enroll in a few SI classes fall semester.  You can get started on the essays since they stay the same every year. Try to focus the personal essay on why you‚Äôre interested and what you can bring to ‚Äúthe intersection of people, information, and technology‚Äù (it‚Äôs kinda their thing). I‚Äôd try to wait until taking SI 110 to start the other essay (I edited one of the writing assignments for that class and used that).  You can try to work on some design projects or your portfolio to supplement your application, but you definitely should find some people who would be willing to write you a letter of rec. For me, I was working on research with a UMSI faculty member (which I recommend since it helped me figure out that I wanted to pursue the BSI program), and he wrote my letter of rec.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions and best of luck!
post,Miscellaneous,positive,\*\*UPDATE\*\* Someone on Reddit found them and brought them back to me! Words cannot describe how happy I was, the Reddit community really is amazing. Thank you  Hi,  I lost my airpods while near the big hill in the Arb today. I don't even remember why I was dumb enough to bring them but I was extremely sad when I couldn't find them in the snow. If you find them, honestly you deserve to keep them but I would really appreciate it if you could dm me. I'll pay you to get them back. Thank you so much

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi guys,  I recently got accepted to my masters program for engineering at UofM (Integrative Systems + Design) and curious about GSI positions. I know most positions are given to PhD students, but some masters students as well.  -Can anyone talk about their experience with being a GSI (specially for engineering)?  -How do you know about open positions? Is it something you have to talk with a professor beforehand?  -Did you have enough time to do well in your courses?  -I‚Äôm planning on taking 15 credits in the Fall along with doing a GSI position, not sure if that‚Äôs too much.  P.S. I did my undergrad at UofM and coming back to school after getting a couple years of work experience.  Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,This will wildly vary by department and even more so by course/professor. For example my department posts GSI positions the semester before. So a first year student starting in the fall wouldn‚Äôt have eligibility to be a GSI until their first winter semester.   I will say in general, most grad programs 9 credits is full time status. So 15 credits at the graduate level will keep you very busy
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Currently a gsi.  1 open positions are usually handled by a point person. Usually there a call for applications where you submit resume interested classes etc... its typically the semester before the class starts.  2. Depends on class you gsi. I've gsi'ed twice both during zoom university era. Its been difficult. I'm doing lesson plans from scratch, teaching, grading, office hrs, and meetings. That said, some other gsis have chill work schedules. You'll need to ask around.   3. I don't have classes but my gsi hrs take 25-30 hrs a week. Classes would be difficult   4. Not all units are equal so it might idk.  But grad school >>> undergrad in terms of difficulty and workload imo. Since you're familiar with um already the learning curve may be lower for you
post,Housing,positive,Hey all! I am looking to sublet a private bedroom and bathroom in a great apartment near the medical campus. Roommates (2) are graduate student/young professional women and I am looking for someone in a similar situation to take over the lease with an option to re-lease for the 2021 school year. I‚Äôve posted in the obvious channels and am trying to go outside of the box a bit to find someone who‚Äôs a good fit. It‚Äôs a great apartment and the roommates are really good people who are very easygoing and great to live with. Looking for someone similar who is COVID-conscientious and easy going/clean. Message me if you are interested or know of someone who may be- I can provide more information there. Thanks!
post,Research,negative,Hey all, I was wondering if we could compile a list of labs, groups, and other research organizations on campus to avoid as an undergraduate researcher? Our collective knowledge could save our peers a lot of grief. Especially with the amount of remote work right now, I imagine that there are more bad assistant roles than ever before. This was inspired by a response I just received to an old post, so I can lead by example and let you know to avoid the [Statistics Online Computational Resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/j30vj9/what_is_spacekime/).
comment,Research,positive,Background- I'm an undergrad with a moderate amount of experience in biology labs.  I think that  although I have had several bad research experiences, I feel like what can make a specific lab/program good or bad mostly depends on what you want out of it.  Additionally, given the nature of undergraduates in labs, what you do within a given lab/program is highly dependent on what you put in and ask for.  As a result, it is perfectly possible for two people to get very different experiences out of a given program or lab.    Also imo programs like the one in your example or like UROP are kinda overrated- if you just email professors you can often get paid roles where you can do basically the same work- and get the same credit without having to deal with any commitments or requirements.    &#x200B;  In conclusion- just make sure you know what you want to get out of a role before you start, and make sure to communicate that with your PI/advisor/program leader.  And if you feel as if you aren't getting what you signed up for, it is entirely ok to seek out a new group.    There is a UM handbook on advisor-student relations that says something very similar to this.
post,Class,positive,Hey folks, Professor Ulaby has been teaching at Michigan for almost 4 decades and has won numerous teaching and research accolades.  To celebrate his career, as he prepares for retirement, I'm trying to collect the perspectives of students who took his courses.  A testimonial, anecdote, anything would be great.  I'm happy to take the anonymously or for you to put your name to them.  It would really mean a lot to us if folks were willing to share.    Feel free to DM me if you want more details.  Thank you so much.
comment,Class,positive,I had him for EECS 215. On the first day he brought us all doughnuts from washtenaw dairy. As we are he told us, "Enjoy, this is the last good thing that will happen to you here." He was a delight, no sarcasm.
comment,Class,negative,I had professor Ulaby during the winter semester my sophomore year and I was severely struggling with academically and personally. Toward the end of the semester, I went into meet with him to talk about my grade in the course (I was failing badly) but he still took the time to talk things over with me about his class and school. While I ended up failing the course, I am graduating this semester and I still credit that meeting with him as one of the reasons I stayed at UofM.
post,Housing,positive,Hi everyone. I will be a senior soon and am looking at doing a co-op for my last year. I'm aware that there are several posts describe some of them briefly, however the most comprehensive of those was from 8 years ago, and even the ones from 8/12 months ago aren't too helpful because the people/vibes change from year to year. Yes, I have also checked each house's website.  Here are some of my characteristics:  * Quiet/Introverted 20F and appreciate a quiet/peaceful environment, even on weekends. * Extremely dedicated to my studies/work, so i avoid the party scene 99% * Not vegetarian * Clean and doesn't like clutter * No drugs/smoking * Prefer privacy so having a single is important.  If anyone who is currently living in one or knows which would be a good fit for me could give me some pointers it would be a huge help!
comment,Housing,positive,Sounds like you would want Gregory. It‚Äôs a drug free house and what I‚Äôve seen every time I‚Äôve been there it is very clean
comment,Housing,positive,Im at Escher rn, it fits that description perfectly, and its the only one where you could guarantee a single.
comment,Housing,positive,Escher seems like it would be a good fit if you are okay with being on north campus. I live there now, and it‚Äôs pretty quiet. You can get a guaranteed single also. There are people here who do drugs / smoke, but there‚Äôs not a big culture of it or anything, it‚Äôs mostly just some individuals who choose to
comment,Housing,positive,North Campus, for sure.
comment,Housing,positive,like others, escher and gregory would be your best bet! you‚Äôd possibly have a double at gregory but then would be on central, but to be on north at escher you‚Äôd have a guaranteed single.

comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,You can reserve a room at the dude. Also most buildings on north campus are open by card access and are usually empty/quiet
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,The chem building has classrooms you can rent out for a few hours at a time. I like those
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,You can reserve a room at the union and also in some other places. If you can use ear plugs, the union actually have some common study rooms available, usually a desk and a comfy chair.  Also East Hall atrium has some chairs and tables (try the psych side, the math guys are badasses).  I think you can also reserve a classroom at the LSA building if you are LSA.  Also Ross got some tables (but it is sometimes busy) and it has a super convenient meeting rooms (but you need to be a Ross student to reserve them).  As it is an exam, you probably do not need to talk during that time, did you try a library?

post,Class,neutral,Hi! I‚Äôm thinking about taking Chem 216 for the spring term. Is the workload manageable? Has anyone taken it online during the spring (or not) who thinks the online version it‚Äôs a bad idea? Thanks!
comment,Class,positive,Hi! I took CHEM 216 last summer while it was online and I thought the workload was quite manageable. It was basically asynchronous except you would meet with a small lab group for 1 hour each week (so you really aren't in lab for 4 hours twice a week). We used a virtual lab thingy called BeyondLabz where you would do the experiments and then there were two worksheets that you had to complete for each lab. There was one lab to complete each week (so 7 labs in total) and you would basically have the entire week to work on it. As well, we had two lecture quizzes that I thought weren't all too bad and there were 3 NMR little quizzes where if you at least attempted to get the correct structure from the NMR, you got 100%. I would say I spent about 2-3 hours each week on this class. I also took this CHEM 216 with CHEM 215 in the summer and, while I still had to spend a good chunk of time on those two classes, I never felt like I was drowning in work and I definitely had lots of free time. Sorry if this is super long, but I hope this helps!!
post,Housing,positive,Hi! My gf just got accepted to UM for her PhD this week! We are both very excited, as well as my mom, who is a UofM alum. I work full time but am remote bc of covid and my boss said I can *probably* go permanent wfh like him. Probably because we may run into  some office politics BS. Im applying to law school next year and Michigan is now my top choice. Our current lease ends in late April so we‚Äôre planning to move to Ann Arbor around then, since it‚Äôs cheaper than where we live now. I‚Äôve been looking at on and off campus housing options, and noticed that, many apartments are only available in the summer. Furthermore I‚Äôm not sure if i would be able to live with her if we did on campus graduate housing (even tho she will be fianc√©e by the time we move). Does anyone have any tips or know any good resources for a mid semester move?
comment,Housing,positive,Ann Arbor housing market revolves around the school. So unlike a major city where you can find a lease any month, most leases here start in May, or august.  This isn‚Äôt all encompassing for the town but particularly true near campus   Graduate housing owned by the university are northwood and munger. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to live as a couple in munger. Northwood does have couples/families living in it, but being that you‚Äôre not married I‚Äôm not sure if that will effect you.  All that being said, if you‚Äôre paying more else where, it sounds like you have the budget to live somewhere decent. Northwood is old and dingy, so you‚Äôd probably be happier to spend your money elsewhere. And your partners programs on central campus, so you could potentially avoid a commute since northwood is on north campus.
comment,Housing,negative,Tip: Don't do on campus graduate housing. Even though im an undergrad, i have lived in the graduate housing places because of covid, and man oh man the apartments were not it. The toilets are tiny, and the tank overflows if you shit more than a pound. The kitchen is tiny, and my oven broke two days in alongside two of the four coils on the stove. 0/10 wouldn't recommend
comment,Housing,positive,What kind of PhD is she getting? I ask because if she is on North Campus most of the time, it may change people's answers.
comment,Housing,positive,Maybe check out Baker Co-op? It‚Äôs the graduate coop on campus and offer some flexible leases!

post,Housing,positive,Wanted to get anyone‚Äôs thoughts on whether or not to sign a lease for next semester.  COVID might not be gone until at least Christmas, so is everyone planning on staying on campus/ renting / just staying at home until at least Winter? Is it even worth staying on campus seeing as college won‚Äôt be the same with all the mask wearing and precautions?   Thoughts? Much appreciated!
comment,Housing,positive,I‚Äôm personally gonna wait since I live in Ann Arbor anyway. I‚Äôm pretty confident in my ability to find housing last minute as there always are openings regardless of how the large companies try to rush you to sign and there will also be many people looking to sublease like always even without covid.
comment,Housing,positive,At that point, most ppl on campus will either be vaccinated or have had it, so I don‚Äôt think it will be nearly as big as this semester.  Also there‚Äôs a lot of ppl itching to go back to normal, I think it‚Äôll be worth it to come to campus.
comment,Housing,positive,Personally speaking, my criteria for signing a lease or otherwise committing to be on campus next fall is the following:  - The university commits to on-campus instruction for most of my classes while requiring vaccinations for everybody physically attending classes, working, or visiting campus - I complete my vaccinations at least two weeks before classes start - There is scientific consensus around how long protection from the vaccines last, and the CDC releases guidelines on booster shots or further vaccinations - Production and distribution of vaccines are sufficient enough that I‚Äôm confident I can receive CDC recommended additional doses on schedule  If any of these criteria aren‚Äôt met, I‚Äôm not taking the risk of signing a lease for the privilege of being close to campus; I‚Äôd rather take the online option or commute with a student orange parking permit.
comment,Housing,negative,I wouldn't. Covid will still be a problem in the fall and campus is a covid hotspot.

post,Prospective Student,neutral,Got into ROSS but needa get out of calc 1. Currently in AB(highest offered at my school) what. can I do to get 4?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,While I can‚Äôt exactly give advice on APCalc I can remind that, worst worst case scenario, if you don‚Äôt get the score you want, you can take Calc-1 at a community college and as long as you get like a C or higher you can just transfer the credits to fulfill the requirement and without the grade factoring into your GPA. A lotta people at UMich do that.  Edit: Also, community college classes are so much easier than AP, at least in my experience. And far cheaper than credits at uni
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Buy an ap Calc book and go thru it
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You are required to take calc 1,2 or 3 at Ross depending on where you‚Äôre next step would be so my advice would be to just take calc 1 and do really well unless you need more calc beyond the requirement then try hard to pass and get into calc 2
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Take Calc at a CC this summer
post,Prospective Student,positive,**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for their insights!! You guys are super helpful, it's really appreciated. I apparently had a bit of a misconception about Hill, so I'll probably be applying to WISE! Here's to hoping that goes well. Thank you all!  Hey all! I'm not a huge Reddit user, sorry if I've used the wrong flair or anything like that. I don't really have anyone I know personally I can ask about this, so to the depths of this website it goes!  I'll explain my thought: I was recently admitted into the Class of 2025. Hooray! I'm an Ann Arborite, and Michigan's been my dream school for years. I'm holding out on a few other schools, just to peep my prospects, but I'm pretty sold on Michigan, so it's only a matter of time 'til I'm committed.  I've already got to thinking about housing, and here's where my dilemma is: I'm coming from a very small high school, and am used to a sort of closed-quarters experience with learning. Michigan is, as I know well since I live in Ann Arbor, a *huge* school. So I've been contemplating applying for the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program-- I'm likely going to do a major in either straight Bio or BHS (which is a dilemma I need to sort out in another life, god forbid).  My one issue with it is it's on Hill, which from my experience both living here and passing through seems to be pretty far away from the hustle and bustle of Central Campus. I don't mind having to take long bus rides/bike to my classes (I need to get into shape anyways..) but I definitely don't want to miss the social life that comes about with living on Central Campus.  As I understand it, though, what quad/hall (assuming we're in-person for 2021-22) you end up in is ultimately randomized, so *should* I pass up the opportunity to apply to WISE RP, there's a good chance I'd end up on Hill anyways, only without that supportive bubble of women in STEM.  So, preamble aside, here's my question: would it be worth applying to WISE RP, knowing I might not be happy living on Hill but would have a smaller community like I'm used to? Or should I take the chance to live on Central Campus, but enjoy the social life?  P.S: feel free to correct me if I've gotten anything wrong-- in fact, that'd be super helpful.. a lot of this stuff sometimes goes over my head, haha! Either way, would love to hear from current WISE RP students, or people who live on Hill? Anyone in general would be great, actually. Just people who.. know how housing assignments at Michigan work, as my brain is the size of a walnut.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,i was in WISE and lived in mojo and it was great! if you do randomized housing, you‚Äôre more likely to end up in markley or bursley because they‚Äôre the two largest dorms on campus, and they‚Äôre both more out of the way than mojo is. honestly i specifically applied to wise because i wanted guaranteed housing in mojo, and while it was a quiet dorm, the walk to campus was totally fine and it was nice having the dining hall and gym so close. i also made some of my best friends in WISE, too, and didn‚Äôt miss out on any social stuff on central :)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The Hill doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough hype. I lived in Markley last semester and Mojo this semester (controversial opinion: I prefer markley) and Hill campus has immaculate vibes. You‚Äôll see people playing soccer and spike ball on palmer field, groups studying in the grass, and almost anything else you would see in a college pamphlet. It‚Äôs only like a 10 minute walk to central and I usually enjoy the walk tbh. Anyways, I highly recommend housing anywhere on the hill.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,MoJo is a great location. Apply for WISE.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Congratulations!  Ann Arborite, coming from a very small high school, I've got to ask: gryphons, or rainbow zebras?  Given your preference for something with a more community feel, I'd go with WISE housing.  The Hill isn't that far removed from the campus center of gravity, and if you go randomized, not only might you wind up on the Hill anyways, you might get Markley, or even worse, Bursley or the crappy one down by the stadium.

comment,Housing,positive,How are you currently paying for your lodging? If you live in a dorm that‚Äôs covered by scholarship, often if you move off campus that money will go to you directly to pay rent. So double check your funding cause you may realize you have a larger budget then you may think  Ways to get Cheaper rent - share a bedroom with someone else Live further from campus  I have a friend live in a shared bedroom somewhere near north campus for 400$ a month  I had a friend live south of the mall with a few roommates, had her own room and she paid 450$  Basically if you‚Äôre on a budget, you unfortunately loose out in some other area whether that be proximity to campus or privacy in your living set up

comment,Housing,neutral,You could always look at the The Ride bus routes. I live a 20 minute bus ride away from campus and pay around $1100 for my one bedroom. Yeah, still kinda pricey. But much lower than my classmates paying $2500 for studios downtown.
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello everyone! I have applied to UMich for the CS-Eng major. I have my goal set on being a Machine Learning engineering, and I believe taking data science courses would benefit my endeavors towards this career path. Does anyone have recommendations or suggestions for particular courses that focus on Data Science concepts? Thank you for any advice!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,A bunch of the the "upper level" stats courses are great.  You dive into concepts that have been branded into the modern day "machine learning" stack.  401, 403, 406, 408, 415, 425, 449, 470  Each one of these classes, at some point, addresses something ML-related.  I've taken most of them and work on ML in the industry, FWIW.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Eecs 445 is machine learning and stats 415 uses statistical learning
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Definitely look into doing a Statistics minor. If you take EECS 445, that will already count as one of the courses, and you only need 5 classes for the minor (but talk to an advisor and make a plan beforehand).

post,Degree,positive,I‚Äôm deciding between the DS and Stats major and most of the classes seem the same. I‚Äôm definitely more interested in Stats and plan to get my Masters in Stats or Computational Math. My ultimate goal after grad school is a career in Data Science. I know that many Data Science majors end up in software engineering, but that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm considering so either major seems pretty similar to me. I‚Äôve taken up till eecs 280 so I also have some programming experience. I‚Äôm not so keen on taking 281 and would rather take stats courses instead which is why I‚Äôm considering Stats over DS. Does anyone have insight on which major would be better for job/academic goals?
comment,Degree,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Degree,positive,If you want to do grad school in Data Science I recommend taking 281.
comment,Degree,positive,I'm a junior looking to go to grad school in Stats/Applied Math, and am pursuing a major in Applied Math and a minor in CS. I was doing a Stats major for the longest time, but switched because nearly all grad schools require real analysis and other more heavy duty math classes. The nice thing about Applied Math is that you still end up taking a lot of the Stats classes you would take as a stats major anyway (406, 426, etc.)
post,Satellite Campus,positive,Kind of facing a dilemma right now. In state and Umich has been dream school for a while now. I recently got admitted to LSA and will prob do pre med alongside a math related major. The total cost of Ann Arbor over 4 years will be around 100-120k and it probably won't be a sore point for us financially. However, I recently got a full tuition scholarship at Umich Dearborn and the added cost of car, gas, and parking will only result to around 8-10k over 4 years. As a entering pre-med do you think I should go with Ann Arbor or save money at Dearborn. I am thankfully not in a financial crush or anything but is Ann Arbor really worth 100k more?
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,Personally, I think you should go to Ann Arbor if you're not being stretched too thin financially. Coming from a pre-med with a sibling that goes to UM-Dearborn, the opportunities I've gotten from Ann Arbor in terms of research and volunteering are much better than the opportunities at the Dearborn campus since we have the hospital here and a lot more funding/bigger/etc. So, as long as you can financially handle it, its worth every cent because of the experiences and opportunities that come with the AA campus
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,Most people who think they‚Äôre interested in med school as high school seniors change their minds. If you only end up with an undergraduate degree, you‚Äôll have better opportunities on the job market if that degree is from UM-Ann Arbor. Assuming you can afford it without significant debt.  There‚Äôs also a huge difference in your college experience between living on campus at a highly ranked research university and commuting to a satellite campus. Again, if you can afford it, the former is preferable for most people.
comment,Satellite Campus,neutral,Why not split the difference and take your pre reqs at Dearborn and then apply for transfer?
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,As unfortunate as it is, attending UM Dearborn would likely close some doors and opportunities that you otherwise would have had. They're not the same school, they really don't share anything but the name. UM Ann Arbor is a much higher ranked school with greater opportunities and support.  Pre-med is a long-shot regardless, but you would stand a much greater chance by attending UM Ann Arbor.
comment,Satellite Campus,positive,I'm not pre-med, but I am in the bio track and was in a similar situation a few years ago. I regret choosing Ann Arbor simply because of the insane cost even if you're in state. It's just not worth it for me.  Depending on how comfortable you are financially you might benefit from being in Ann Arbor just because the hospital is here, but other than that I would say the better option is to go to Dearborn and save your money for med school.

post,Prospective Student,negative,Incoming transfer here. I spent freshman year in Wayne where I took Linear Algebra, Calc 3, and standard physics 1 and 2 courses. I spent sophomore year at Michigan State where I took Analysis 1 and 2 (counts at MATH 451 at Umich), Abstract Algebra 1 and 2 (MATH412 at Umich), Modern Physics (doesn‚Äôt count as PHYSICS 390 at Umich), and Classical Mechanics 1 (also doesn‚Äôt count as PHYSICS 401). Basically all these classes weren‚Äôt difficult at all, really. In the fall, I‚Äôll be transferring to Umich LSA and will \*probably\* be taking PHYSICS 340, 351, 390 and MATH 420 in my first semester. Is this too much? I‚Äôm expecting an incline in difficulty but how steep is that incline? Should I expect increased difficulty in course pace, course rigor, course homework, course exams or all of the above? Any input would be appreciated.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I will say that 340 is not a fun time, the instructor who normally teaches it is not a good teacher imo. Math 420 isnt too bad (content is relatively easy) nor is physics 351, but I dropped 390 bc I hate labs and decided the interesting lectures weren't worth doing the labs.   Michigan math in general is hard, there are very few classes (if any) I would describe as "easy" (though I've mostly opted for the honors courses with an exception or two, so I can't speak to some of them). Be prepared for a lot of work. I wish there were english analogues, but michigan math isnt —Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω—ã–π as much as it is —Ç—è–∂—ë–ª—ã–π, the work is long and and requires a lot of work, it isnt that it is just straight up impossible
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Not there yet personally, but physics major. I think that 390 has a mandatory corequisite of 391 (which is apparently quite heavy in workload), unless you can get it waived. You can see student's perception of workload at [atlas.ai.umich.edu](https://atlas.ai.umich.edu). Next semester I'm planning on taking a similar courseload, actually (physics 360, 351, math 451), so hopefully it's not too bad! You do have a head start in the physics too, so it may not be so bad since you've effectively taken them. Also as u/Veauros mentioned, you can definitely start out with them all and then drop it if it's too much
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Definitely much heavier. I‚Äôve taken almost all the 400 level physics courses and 300 level as well, and I have a friend at MSU and it‚Äôs quite different there. At MSU, there‚Äôs two semester spent to teach what UMich teaches in one semester for physics 401 and 405. And the classes are much more math intensive, and are very theoretical physics based. Feel free to PM me with more questions!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Can't weigh in on the physics, but I am a math major. Part of the reason these math classes seemed easy might have been that you were covering in two semesters, what a class here would cover in one. Or you're just really good at math. Either way, you should expect 420 to require a pretty decent amount of time. I assume this isn't your first linear algebra course?  I do actually have a friend in Physics 351 right now. It looks like a smattering of different topics from calc 3, linear algebra, and differential equations that pop up in physics. I can't testify to the difficulty of the class, but it doesn't look too bad.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Idk about physics but In general, there is a tendency at Michigan math to cram too much content into one semester. Also an issue in Engineering.

comment,Prospective Student,negative,There is a discord! [https://discord.gg/CAg3WSVrN5](https://discord.gg/CAg3WSVrN5)
post,Employment,positive,Hi, I am just looking for advice/guidance on how to handle graduating in December.  I will graduate this December with an EECS undergrad degree and am curious how December grads have handled their next steps.  Some general questions of mine:  1. When did you start reaching out to companies about full-time employment? 2. What was the timeline like for the applications? At what point did you interview and receive full-time offers (was it during the fall? November-ish? Not until after you'd already graduated?) 3. For what part of the year (or how long after graduation) did you tell companies you were searching for a job? January right after graduating? Spring? Summer? The following fall? 4. How beneficial was the fall career fair (the year of your graduation)? 5. How did your previous internships help? Did you receive return offers? If so, when did you receive them? What was that process like? 6. If you did not work starting right after graduation, what did you do until you began work? 7. If you had a lease until the following May or September in Ann Arbor, how did you handle that? Did you search for remote work until it expired? Did you just sublet to someone else instead and begin work elsewhere anyways? 8. Any other general advice or tips?  Any insights would be super helpful.  In terms of my status, my only internship experience will be this summer (it was cancelled last year). I haven't yet done much to reach out to companies about full-time work. There are a couple companies I interviewed for an internship with and withdrew my app once I accepted my internship, so I think I will prioritize reaching out to them about full-time (as well as many other companies).  Thanks so much!
comment,Employment,positive,Why is this being downvoted? I am just asking for advice.  e: thanks for the upvotes. anyone got advice?
comment,Employment,positive,Going to career fair in September to look for a job starting in January is totally reasonable. Most established companies have a new grad hire cycle that starts in August (when they decide whether to extend offers to interns) to March/April.  Doing well at your internship is important. For the company running an internship program is a cost drain; they run it because it‚Äôs an investment to find future talent, not because hiring a 20-something for 10 weeks adds any value to their business. Personally I would hold off on applying until you get most of the way through your internship because you will then have some actual experience to talk about and more of an idea about what you‚Äôre looking for.  My experience is the best way to find a job is to focus on building connections, not applying to job posts. The naive way to apply for jobs is to write a resume and generic cover letter (‚Äúthe job posting requires a cover letter so I guess I‚Äôll write one‚Äù), sweat every grammatical issue, apply to a hundred job postings, and never even hear back from most of them. A better way is to go to tech talks, career fair, workshops, etc and actually talk to recruiters and industry professionals to understand their business challenges and what they are looking for. Not in a superficial ‚Äúhere‚Äôs my 60 second elevator pitch‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask a technical question so you‚Äôll think I‚Äôm smart‚Äù way but a genuine conversation to figure out how you can bring value to their business and what skills they are looking for.  Also, right now we‚Äôre in a massive recession and most companies have cut back on hiring. That means you may have to work harder to get an actual offer and it may not be your dream job. But there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt work your way up; and having a job is a better way to do that then no job.  Hope that‚Äôs helpful, feel free to DM me if you want any more specific advice!

comment,Employment,positive,I graduated this past December and am now working in the tech industry. I started preparing for interviews in July and recruiting in late August ‚Äî I was super intense about it and ended up doing a few dozen interviews, and ultimately began receiving offers mid October and decided on the company early November. I started work in January after graduation, but Covid has a big effect on thar decision because I didn‚Äôt really have much to do after graduation, but I know people who start work in March or May or August. For me, the fall career fair wasn‚Äôt helpful really at all and I didn‚Äôt go to the one online, but a lot of my friends found their jobs at career fair so I wouldn‚Äôt completely right it off, especially if you are looking to learn more about smaller companies. I am currently working at the company I interned for the past 2 summers, and I think the name on my resume went a long way for the recruiting process but I didn‚Äôt receive a return offer until end of October when I had a competing off that was going to expire, and it was super fustrating because it took so long to hear back and it was hard making career decisions, but luckily the other offers helped them expedite the process. My current lease in AA is until August, but because my work is online right now I am still living here until  have to go to the office. My best advice to you is practice practice practice ‚Äî I interviewed and mock interviewed and practiced leet code until I was super confident in my ability to succeed in interviews, so that meant just taking any interview I could get and recruiting super hard so I could see all my options and be able to prepare really well.
comment,Employment,positive,Congrats on surviving Michigan engineering! Are you EE/ECE or CS? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever too early to start networking. If you‚Äôre EE, one strategy is reaching out to alumni who are working at places that interest you. That can be especially effective at medium/smaller companies. Idk anything about CS other than that it seems like you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to find something as long as you‚Äôre willing to apply to a ton of places.

comment,New Student,neutral,You are a umsi student? Can i interview you for my si class?
post,Food / Culture,negative,Hi, I‚Äôm not from around here so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the norm in this case. I know tipping in general is customary in the US but what about when you literally order food at a restaurant for to-go?? Do they expect tips from broke college students even if you didn‚Äôt really get any service? Am I a dick for not tipping? I don‚Äôt wanna reduce expected pay for an employee but I also am not exactly flowing in cash myself so I just a want to know what‚Äôs the right thing to do.
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Pre covid I didn't tip ans I don't know many people who did tip. During covid, ill tip around 15%
comment,Food / Culture,negative,historically the answer is no. however, there is a growing segment of people that seem to disagree. I personally think it's been spurred on some by the advent of those Square payment terminals with a built in "Add a tip" function.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,YES. SANTA IS WATCHING YOU
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I used to tip just a nominal amount, or even 0, for carryout, since we weren't getting table service.  Since pandemic I've tipped because of the general situation:  Servers not able to earn usual tips due to restrictions on in-person dining, restaurant workers hours being cut, concern about the risk they face on the job, etc.  So I tip the same as I would for table service.  That said, there are some restaurants that don't have a system for tipping on carryout and I have to admit that feels like a treat (not having that extra cost).
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,I don't
comment,Food / Culture,positive,You should tip but not in the same way you would for sit down. It seems like not much goes into putting together a to-go order but that just isn't true. I worked doing to-go over the summer at a restaurant that didn't have sit down because of covid and I busted my ass doing to-go orders. Since I took orders over the phone, I'm still expected to have knowledge about the menu that I help customers through when they have questions, the dishes still come up at the window in whatever order they're complete just like with sit down so I still have to organize those dishes according to which ticket they belong to, and I still have to get drink order done and all of that.  That said, I have different expectations from college students than I do full adults... and I have different expectations for to-go than I do for sit down. For example: from sit down i would expect no less than a 15% tip, but typically around 18%. But for to-go... 5% is a little low, and 10% is the average. (Meaning some people tip more, some people tip less) if you ordered $15 worth of food. I would expect no more than $2 of tip (and when I say expect i don't mean I think I deserve--i just mean thats typically how much I get on such an order).  The thing with to-go order is thT they *do* require less work, and I am able to do more of them in a shift than I would have with sit down. So I dont expect the same amount in tips/customer... and I'll probably end up making the same amount even though the average tip per customer is half as much.  And just to add... to-go orders is not "just handing the customer their food" and nothing more. There is more that goes into it, and there are people who are bad at it. There are people who slow down the process, who do the job poorly resulting in longer wait times, who put orders together improperly resulting in dishes missing in some bags and extra dishes in others while some dishes have no homes because a bag left without it. So....
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,You should tip. Especially with covid
comment,Food / Culture,negative,Yes. They are fucked.
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,pre-covid, i've always thought the norm was 10% on to go orders. now i tip 20% on to go orders  usually at restaurants the people running to-go are employees who are not get paid min wage bc its assumed that tips will cover the rest
comment,Food / Culture,negative,If a server is involved in prepping your to-go order, taking orders over the phone, clarifying details, giving you status updates, checking the order against the ticket, bagging it, adding dressings and napkins and utensils as needed, and checking you out, be aware that they're probably making a base wage of $3.67 per hour, Michigan's minimum for tipped workers, under the assumption that most customers tip them.  Attitudes vary, some people never tip servers, whether for table or take out service, while some always do, but it's at least good to understand the pay system. When a server's base wage ($3.67/hr) plus tips fail to meet Michigan's minimum wage of $9.65/hr for a pay period, the employer is supposed to make up the difference to bring their pay up to $9.65/hr. But if a server ordinarily makes $15/hr in wages and tips serving tables, and now spends half their time serving takeout customers who don't tip, the average of that $15/hr and $3.67/hr work will mean their take-home pay has effectively dropped to $9.65 per hour.   You may want to ask an employee how tips are distributed at their particular restaurant, as restaurants are increasingly taking tips from servers to distribute to other workers anyway, and in certain cases using loopholes for owners or managers to pocket tips for themselves.  Some may have different policies on tips from phoned orders vs. online orders.
post,Prospective Student,positive,So I have a questions. I have a interest of being a accountant so I applied to UMICH LSA and then Ross but I got into LSA summer program so then Ross automatically couldn't review my application so now I will have to apply for Ross in my freshmen year.  The only thing stopping me from going to UMICH is if I don't get into Ross after freshmen year I can't do business and I really want to do accounting if not something business related. I heard about the 1 year masters of accounting program so can I join that program without being in Ross?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,From my understanding of accounting, you undergrad degree is usually what teach you most of the actual accounting skills then the masters is there to help you get your CPA. I would think your chances of getting into the masters with zero accounting experience would be low (but the best way to figure this out is to look at the website or email the department for info)

post,Class,neutral,To anyone who has taken it, how is the workload? Is it manageable? Or would you rather have taken it during fall and winter semester?
comment,Class,positive,I took it this past spring. It really wasn‚Äôt too bad. I had class MTThF 2-4 and lab TTh 10-12 if I can remember correctly. I would work at my job MWF as late as possible and then do physics after that. I enjoyed only being able to focus on one class. I‚Äôm really glad I did it but it was also start of Covid times and I had literally nothing else to do other than work so maybe that made it a bit different? Not sure
comment,Class,negative,I really hated that class. I dislike physics, so I‚Äôm a little biased already, but I just hated the material and how it was taught (235 ended up being SO MUCH better tho). Lau wasn‚Äôt the best but William, the GSI, was the only reason I did well and 100% go to his OH if he‚Äôs the GSI again
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm in it rn, albeit the csp version, and the workload is noticeable.  Although it should be noted I‚Äôm not really a fan of physics 135, I‚Äôd prefer Orgo or bio.  I would think it‚Äôs doable in Spring/Summer, although I wouldn‚Äôt encourage.  If you have taken chem 130, the workload of physics 135 is a greater and the exams are harder.  I would be inclined to say they are harder than bio 172 as well, but definitely easier than Orgo.  Idk that helps, but good luck.

post,Health / Wellness,negative,Howdy y'all (typing this on many painkillers),  I guess this is just a silly rant to keep me occupied as I recover from my latest non-covid illness, which I fully believe is tonsilitis. About once a year since I've started college, my tonsils swell up for around 4 days, and I catch a bit of a fever as a result- for the last two years, I've gone to get tested at UHS to see if my suspicions were correct (not able to this year, covid cautious) but everytime, they did the exact same thing-  "Yeah we think it's mono"  Well, I'm not experiencing fatigue so I'm not sure--  "Nah let's get you tested for mono üíñ"  Many negative mono tests later, they dont try to figure anything out, give me an ibuprofen, and send me out into the world sick as a dog (the wildest thing about pre-covid times tbh).   Has anyone else had this feeling that no matter what you go to UHS with, they will test you for mono? Not that I'm complaining of course, it's a common collegiate affliction and it's good to get thr suspicion out of the way- it's just sad that if you don't have mono, they don't do much else for you. Also my roomies think I should seek medical attention for my tonsils, but because of this experience I dont feel comfortable going back to UHS (the only healthcare i can afford- have had very unproductive and expensive experiences with the hospital!) so who knows if this is serious or not.  Lol again I am on painkillers so apologies if this comes off weird!
comment,Health / Wellness,negative, As you have noted, mono is extremely common and contagious. It‚Äôs best to test for and catch it before it spreads rapidly to other students (universities can be cesspools for this). As for tonsillitis, it‚Äôs an infection and immune response caused by something else (usually another infection). For example, I used to get horrible tonsil inflammation every time cold and allergy season hit. It would hurt to eat and it was impossible to even swallow my own spit. Unfortunately if doctors rule that your symptoms aren‚Äôt bad enough (meaning that your tonsils aren‚Äôt filled with pus, they‚Äôre not bleeding, or there‚Äôs no abnormal rash outside the typical redness inflammation causes) they‚Äôll just give you some anti inflammatory medication or tell you to take some ibuprofen. Tonsillitis is a symptom of another issue and they probably deemed your cases too mild and tested for strep and/or mono just to rule them out. If your tonsils regularly bother you that much from whats likely a minor infection like a cold, I highly recommend finding a ENT doctor who will remove them.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,When I was in college at a different university, it was pregnancy.  Like dude, trust me when I say there is NO WAY I could be pregnant and try to actually treat me instead of seeing me as a walking uterus, OK?
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I'd say just try another clinician. If it's not mono and then they aren't further doing anything for you then just call the next day and say your symptoms are still bad and that you want to be seen again. They should tell you who you're going to see so if it is the same clinician just say you don't want to see them again; the scheduling staff doesn't care.   Personally I like Dr. Maslach, Dr. Wilcox, and Brian Lent (he's a PA). The former two are really hard to get on the schedule quickly but Brian is often available for same day visits. Some clinicians work better for some people than others. If you find somebody you like, remember their name and you can ask for them if you're doing any routine care (since it sounds like you're using UHS as your primary care physician). You can also ask for them for same day appointments but with those it's kind of a beggars can't be choosers kind of deal.   Also I know it sounds like money is tight but if you're constantly having tonsillitis you may want to be evaluated for your tonsils to be removed. Consider asking for a referral to see otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat specialists) to ask if that's right for you.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,This happened to me. I felt it was tonsilitis and it was. They prescribed me penicillin but i also was tested for mono
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Never had an issue with them looking for Mono, but last I went to UHS they checked me over, took my blood, and did a scan of my lungs to figure out why I was having such a hard time breathing.    They had absolutely no idea and I finally got in with my immunologist, who needed a stethoscope to initially determine that I had both pneumonia and bronchitis.  So thanks UHS.

post,Class,negative,Anyone have advice? I genuinely don't know how to do well in this class :( My lab report answers are always very thorough, but I always miss a detail the graders wanted but didn't explicitly state. Every lab I ask my GSI so many questions but still end up doing bad on the report. There's no office hours, no Piazza, and lab reports are submitted at the end of your lab's timeframe, so every week I feel like I'm going in blind without much external support. And every lab feels rushed.  Idk if this is another course where a lot of grade depends on how your GSI grades, but grading has me worried nonetheless because you need to score one standard deviation above the class mean to get an A. I've been getting below average scores on the labs, like 27/33 or 28/33 and I just want to succeed :/
comment,Class,positive,I took it last semester and it's really just dependent on how your GSI grades. I know that sucks to hear and I don't have much advice besides maybe email your GSI and ask how to improve. I sort of just accepted my grade since the class is only 1 credit and really has little impact on your GPA.  You could also email to express your frustrations with how the class is being run/graded if you think that is a big issue and hopefully they will care enough to do something but seems like they haven't done much to improve since last semester.

post,Housing,positive,Yes haha I'm posting this to Reddit since me and my roommate are facing an extremely difficult financial situation and need to move out of our apartment ASAP.   Subleasing a 2-bed room in a 2 bedroom unit at Zaragon West, move in ASAP and move out will be July 2021. I have two leases available since it is a split bedroom; one is $740 before utilities (price is negotiable and I will be paying utilities) and the other is $710 before utilities (price and utility coverage negotiable). There are two other girls in the unit and a really really cute cat.   Location: Right downtown, < 5 minute walk to the diag, < 5 minute walk to the Union, right by State St. Really great location if you're looking to stay on Central Campus, or looking to live in the city with all its restaurants and bars within walking distance.   Amenities: Laundry is included in the unit, trash room is right down the hall, two high-speed wifis, there is a 24/7 gym downstairs, and there is a parking garage available (parking spot not included). The building and management are also very Covid safe.  This place is very cozy and city-like, and I'm sad to leave but if you're an undergraduate or even a graduate student trying to find housing quickly, this is a great option!

post,Student Organization,positive,Hey guys, just got up to date with all of beginning of semester/early semester workload and am looking to join a few more clubs. Was wondering if anyone knew of any that were still accepting applications/members this late.
comment,Student Organization,positive,If you hear of a club you find interesting I'd reach out to their president/leadership. Most clubs I know of are pretty much always taking on new members!
comment,Student Organization,positive,You could reach out to What the F magazine. They‚Äôre always happy to take on writers, artists, and other staff members.
comment,Student Organization,positive,If you like game music you could join the Video Game Music Club . We are always just open you just gotta email us to send the discord linkü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
comment,Student Organization,positive,I highly recommend an engineering project team if you're looking to learn something! Pretty much regardless of your major, you can find a team that will want you and help you learn new skills your classes will never teach you.
post,Class,positive,Please tell me that everything will be okay so my quarantine addled brain will calm down üò≠
comment,Class,positive,It depends on your professor.   Send them an email letting them know and begging forgiveness (haha). My two friends who are professors would accept it no problem, and laugh at your email, but there are also a lot of dicks out there.
comment,Class,positive,I wish I could
comment,Class,positive,If it's just through email, I'm sure you are fine. Those with submission systems like Gradescope are less tolerant
comment,Class,negative,I submitted 2 papers late to a upper level history course looong before covid and nobody said anything or took off points. Some professors are very chill about it. Say you are in a different timezone and got confused or internet lagged, they‚Äôll turn a blind a especially for 1 minute
post,Student Organization,positive,anyone have experience with spoon university? i just applied to join but i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs competitive to get accepted or more of an open club?
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello!  As a prospective LSA student, I was wondering what are the exact pre-med courses you have to take? If someone could list the specific courses they took, that would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The required pre-med courses are more dependent on the requirements of the medical school that you are applying to; LSA has no official pre-med requirements. That being said, there is a worksheet you will get for this with the general requirements that are common among medical schools:   Intro bio sequence: BIO171/172 (or AP credit) and BIO173  2 upper level bio lectures and 1 upper level lab  Physics I and II: most life sciences people take PHYSICS135 and PHYSICS235, if they didn't test out with AP  Gen Chem: CHEM130 or AP credit  ORGO: CHEM210/211, and CHEM215/216  P Chem: CHEM230 or CHEM260  Biochem: MCDB310, BiolChem415, or CHEM351  Psych111 (or AP credit), and another class with a focus on health disparities

Over 120,000 people have gotten through that, you (and my son) can get through this version of "Groundhogs Day."  Stay strong & Beat Navy.
post,Employment,positive,Hey there, anyone work with Rivian before? What‚Äôs their company culture like, and what is it like interning for them? Also interview tips would be much appreciated!
comment,Employment,positive,I haven‚Äôt and don‚Äôt work for Rivian but I can tell you that their leadership/management tends to come from the existing big three (Ford, GM, FCA). So expect culture carry over but with a startup twist.   That being said, they‚Äôve been operational for a really long time (12-13 year iirc) but they‚Äôre products (SUV/Truck/Vans) are only being released recently or soon. So expect some excitement or turbulence there.  Other than that, the interviews weren‚Äôt that crazy when I interviewed last year. Managers tend to be younger (3-8 YOE) so there‚Äôs not too much a generational/industry skill gap.
comment,Employment,positive,I interned at Rivian and had a great experience. Feel free to PM me.
post,Health / Wellness,positive,Most of you have probably read the post about a fellow student being involuntarily committed to the psych ward. You can find the post here: https://reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lmcym3/i_got_rejected_from_um_phd_program_and_i_was/  and some more advice here: https://reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lmcym3/_/gnuutb4/?context=1  I realised that a lot of people might not be aware of some nuances of this process and might not know what will/will not get them in trouble.   Here are some tips I have after personally been through the process. Feel free to correct me if any of this is outdated (my experience was pre-covid). Feel free to add things I missed too. This is a repost of my comment in that thread.   Please keep in mind that this is NOT mental health advice, but self preservation advice. Also since I‚Äôm an international student, the advice applies more for our fellow internationals.   1.	before devulging any mental health struggles, please find out what the person could and would do with this information. Some professors/advisors are obligated to report you, some are not. Most therapists/psych professionals will only involve the police/psych ward if they believe you‚Äôre a danger to yourself or others. In this case, you are allowed to be passively suicidal, as long as you have no access to weapons and do not have a plan and do not intend to make a plan. 2.	If you are NOT ACTIVELY SUICIDAL and decide to call the CAPS number on the back of the M Card because you‚Äôre really going through something and would like to call someone, please be careful. They will ask you for your address. **You are allowed to not give it.** If they think that you‚Äôre in danger, they **will** call DPSS on you, and they **will** charge into your room and forcefully drag you to the psych ward. This process is honestly more like an arrest minus the handcuffs than trying to help you. Obviously they can‚Äôt do this if you 1. don‚Äôt give them an address or a full name and 2. make it clear that you have no intent to complete suicide. (Honestly I recommend a non-UM helpline).  3.	If unfortunately you do end up in the UM psych ward, here are some things you should know. if you are an international student, your insurance covers all costs. **However**, if your parents are not tolerant of mental health issues, **check your billing address**. The psych ward will send an itemized bill and your parents will definitely know if it gets sent to your house. Also **check your emergency contact**, since they will get called. I recommend setting it as your best friend/SO in Michigan. As OP said, you are not allowed your phone (or any other personal belongings tbh) most of the time, but you can call your friends with a phone they provide. Your friends are allowed to bring you things that have been deemed to not be a risk.  4.	Other random psych ward facts (pre-covid): You‚Äôre allowed to mingle with other inpatients and you‚Äôll probably have a roommate. Your friends are allowed to visit every day for about 6 hours. Nicotine gum/patches are available if you need it. The bed is not too comfortable, I recommend you ask your friend to bring some items that will bring you comfort (stuffed animals for something). They usually only hold you for a week, and in my experience you will need a friend to sign you out to be discharged.  6.	If it is any consolation the UM psych ward also has unlimited snacks, a lounge area, games and a piano. They also do your laundry for you. Not sure if it makes up for the horrible standard of care though.   It‚Äôs really sad and bleak and many levels of fucked up that these tips are important, and honestly UM psych ward is one of the cruelest places I have personally seen. The nurses say horrid, unqualified things (told my best friend they are responsible for my life) and they treat you so dismissively and almost with contempt.   However, on the bright side:  -	if you‚Äôre international, therapy is 90% covered and anti-depressants are 99.9% covered. -	a lot of professors are very compassionate. Please write that email and ask them for help if you are suffering.  Sorry this got really long, but I hope it helps someone. Also, thank you to u/ReachTheMoon30 for telling your story and u/MiskatonicDreams for your advice.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I don‚Äôt even know how to reach out to professors / anyone else. CAPS has sucked : (
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Excellent post. Thank you for taking the time to write it and hopefully many will read it. The CAPS website has a list of Preferred Providers that specialize in college age individuals and have attended trainings with CAPS and UHS. It hadn‚Äôt been updated since Covid I think but the names of the therapists are all good. Psychology Today also has a ‚ÄúFind a Therapist‚Äù tool that can help you narrow the fields with specifics you like. Also, feel free to DM me as I am a therapist in Ann Arbor and can help anyone navigate services. Please reach out to someone.  Edited for so many typos

comment,Media,positive,I‚Äôm reasonably liberal but solidly with Biden on this one. Forgiving student loans isn‚Äôt going to solve the problem of schools charging $20-60k a year for tuition for programs that will get you a 30k per year job out of college.  If you really want to solve the problem, then we need to find a way to make college either more affordable or free. Forgiving away all the debt will just tell the colleges to charge more, in addition to basically punishing the people who worked like crazy to pay off their student debt.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted to hell for saying this too but... if you need loans, then when you come to college, don‚Äôt major in what you love. Major in what you can like enough and that can get you a job. I like many LSA programs, but some of them just will not get you a good job. If you‚Äôre taking out 100k in loans, you need to choose something valuable to employers.
comment,Media,negative,I‚Äôm getting downvoted for sure. But did any of you ever consider that the real villain is not the loaner or the gvt, but the school that sold you a $200,000 middle easter studies / sociology degree and lied to you about all the opportunities it would bring?
comment,Media,neutral,In what world is it ever responsible to give somebody a loan for $100,000 to pursue, say, an MSW with a starting salary of $40,000? You are knowingly signing somebody up for years of $1,000+ monthly payments and stress because they are under the guise of getting easier access to a field they are probably genuinely passionate about but pays like shit.   I think progressives should really go after egregious school spending *and* irresponsible loan writing. It's a positive feedback loop: more loans being written means schools can charge higher prices due to more students getting loans, which causes people to need more loans, which drives up prices, etc.  Of course blocking people out of loans means less access to school (at least before tuition prices decrease in response), but this is something similar to what we had to grapple with after 2008. People  were getting loans for houses that should not have been getting loans for houses before the crash.  It's obviously not exactly the same, but federal loans for college are very similar to NINJA loans from before 2008. Even worse, as the loans that aren't direct PLUS require no credit checks.
comment,Media,positive,They need to seriously reevaluate how student loans are granted in the US. Teenagers should not be taking tens of thousands of dollars in debt without a realistic plan to pay it back and lenders should not be issuing loans to people with no collateral with no plan to pay it back. There are far better options such as state schools, ROTC, community colleges, and trade schools.
comment,Media,positive,He‚Äôs prepared to give us $10K off, put his money where his mouth is and do it.
comment,Media,negative,the real issue above everything is the ruling the student debt can‚Äôt be discharged in bankruptcy. It‚Äôs insane. Fucking stupid. People everywhere can do all the shit they want, declare bankruptcy, and get a fresh start in 7 year, unless it‚Äôs student loans. Skip the loan forgiveness and just let people discharge it in bankruptcy. That‚Äôs why companies will give kids $200K in loans to get a basket weaving degree. Remove that and banks will actually have to see a bit more about what they give out, and colleges will stop charging so much once their students can‚Äôt get approved for the full amount.
comment,Media,positive,As a freshman who already has thousands of dollars in debt, I think any significant student debt forgiveness is sort of unrealistic. All of us knew what we were getting into before we came to college, but we are willing to take on the debt in hopes that we‚Äôll have a better career in the future. However, like the person talking about people with a MSW said, some professions still won‚Äôt make enough to pay back those loans, even though social workers are very necessary in our society. Perhaps the government or employers or universities could incentivize people to enter professions that don‚Äôt always make a lot of money but are necessary and important by canceling some or all of their student debt. People who are going into professions that typically pay more like doctors or lawyers (myself included) shouldn‚Äôt have cancelled debt. I‚Äôm definitely for lowering tuition, but it won‚Äôt happen. I just think making four year college free for all students would devalue a degree, pushing more and more students to pursue a graduate degree and eventually devaluing that too.   Sorry for the long post.   TL;DR: While I think that giving so many students free four year college would devalue a degree, and that canceling student debt for so many is unrealistic when some people don‚Äôt even get the opportunity to go to college, there are some professions for which a college degree is simply too overpriced for what they are paid. If government spending goes to cancel any college debt, it should go to alumni in lower salary positions that require a college degree, especially those that are critical to the function of society.
comment,Media,neutral,Wait a politician who has been in politics for 50 years isn't doing what he said?
comment,Media,negative,I am 100% with Biden on this one. Feds should not forgive/subsidize dumb decisions made by students.
comment,Media,neutral,the establishment removes the mask!
post,Miscellaneous,positive,I was under the impression that the CS-LSA program wasn't ABET accredited, so I was sort of surprised that CS-LSA students are allowed to attend the Order of the Engineer ceremony that's specifically for students graduating from an ABET accredited program.  Maybe I'm just annoyed that the university likes to pick and choose when CS-LSA students are considered apart of the COE. (I am a CS-LSA student)
comment,Miscellaneous,negative,The whole LSA/CoE situation is ridiculous. They should either be combined into one program or have something that actually makes them different. All the separation does in disadvantage LSA student IMO
post,Research,positive,Hey y'all! Since reddit has been far more helpful than anyone working at the University, I'm back requesting some more guidance.  Now that I am a student at the university, I am following the expectations & protocols regarding career planning. I am not interested in a traditional internship because I desire to go to law school post-graduation with the ultimate goal of becoming an entrepreneur, in the long-term. The purpose of strengthening my technical background for law school is to partake in an emerging industry / legal field called computational law.  Computational law is a framework used to understand how to solve legal issues using data analytics, blockchain/cryptosystems, and bespoke technology development. CL is a branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers). It emphasizes explicit behavioural constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct. Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.  As you can imagine, this field is predicated on many technical concepts, including formal logic, both math and philosophy, which is why I am reaching out to you nerds. I was hoping to speak to someone regarding any research project that may help me develop and advance my understanding of formal logic.  If anyone has ideas on whom I can speak to, or if you are involved with anything personally that we can explore together, I would greatly appreciate any directional steps to achieving my research goals for this summer!  Thanks for your time and consideration, and I look forward to speaking with y'all soon! :)
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,This is my second semester now where one of my upper level profs has decided that they don't need to schedule their exam dates on the syllabus. I can maybe understand assigning homework sporadically, but exams?  Those should be set in stone asap because 1) I need to know how to plan my time to study and 2) I need time to resolve conflicts with other exams. I'd think planning exams is easier now than before because they don't need to book a room for it, and my department has generally given take-home exams with a 2-3 day window. Even if there's an overlap, I can still make that happen.   In my first two years here, I knew every exam day and time on the first day of class when we got syllabi. Last semester I had a prof who, when reminded it was getting late in the semester for a midterm, said "oh, you're right! Let's do the midterm next week." Like bruh I really can't handle that kind of whiplash when I have other classes to worry about.  Idk, I just feel like if they could plan ahead of time in past semesters, there shouldn't be any excuse for an inability to plan now when logistics are easier (at least, that's my experience in COE since exams aren't proctored). I just want the bare minimum here.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Sadly, I think the real answer is that your profs are probably as overwhelmed as you are.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I understand your frustration, and i will add some context being a gsi during zoom university.   I don't think there can be a minimum yet because things are too new.  Keep in mind things are different and profs are experimenting with how to best engage students and because of this things are in flux.  In my personal experience, I'm basically redoing the course plans in real time because last semester the prof tried something new and it failed. And because what I'm doing is unprecedented, schedules have been revised much to the chagrin or delight of students. Exams have been revised or points changed. One exam the average was 30% with an std of 15 points compared to pre covid of 50% and std of 8 points so it's clear the new structure is confusing. So it's up to me the prof and rest of staff to find a way to make things more equitable.  While I do think it's b.s. that profs are dumping exams and assignments without advanced warning, given the circumstances i think its reasonable that things are trying to be done differently, because students are also upset when profs are trying to translate in person expectations to zoom university.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Aero 315?
post,Class,positive,If anyone is currently enrolled in BL 482/582, and interested with having someone to study with for the class (via text etc), please PM me
post,Class,positive,So right now I am taking MATH 316 (DiffEq) through Community High's CR program and its been pretty good so far. I need to plan ahead with my wack schedule (I'm not even in AAPS rip) and my eye has been on MATH 454 (BV probs for PDEs) since I think I'll *probably* be able to take it in the spring semester. However, my prof brought to my attention that MATH 404 (intermediate DEs) is also pretty interesting, and now I'm starting to figure out that it's more of a dynamical systems and chaos theory class as well (right?). I won't be able to take this until next fall though, so I figured what if I do 454 first and then 404? Would that make sense - or does anyone with a good understanding of the courses have a better idea? Also, any pros/cons on these courses? I would like to mention that I am foreshadowing that they will work for my schedule based off of previous years' schedules (which seem to be pretty consistent) - does anyone know when the spring classes are announced? Thanks!
comment,Class,neutral,I'm taking 454 right now, I don't know anything about 404 but you should be able to get through 454 with intro to diffeq and some understanding of linear algebra
comment,Class,positive,I‚Äôm also taking 454 right now, it‚Äôs actually a pretty interesting class, and the course load is pretty low for a math class. Just make sure you have your basic diff eq and Lin alg concepts down, cuz the instructor will only spend a day or two at most on them.
post,Finances,positive,I'm curious to all of you who pay OOS tuition costs for Michigan was it worth the sticker price?  Would you do anything differently?  Did you get all the opportunities you hoped for?  Thanks for the advice.
comment,Finances,positive,It depends on what you do with your time here. College is essentially an investment in yourself. If you study something worthwhile, build up a solid network, and get the best possible experiences, that could help you get a better salary in the future and justify your initial investment. If you want to fuck around or get a useless degree, then the extra out of state cost is definitely not worth it.  My experience being OOS is that it was definitely worth it.  The only good school in my home state was Ivy League, so in state wasn‚Äôt a reliable option for me.  I picked a degree with a lot of career options and now, with one year left of school, I have a few solid options for a full time career that should justify my initial investment.
comment,Finances,positive,It's really contextual. How much is u of m? Is there a cheaper option available? How good are those options? Can you provide details?
comment,Finances,positive,Do 2 years where the price is cheaper, BUT make sure the credits will transfer, THEN go to U of M for the name and price.
comment,Finances,neutral,Not for me
comment,Finances,positive,Well I think so. My other choices were chapel hill or william and mary and I don‚Äôt plan on going to graduate school
comment,Finances,positive,Yeah, parents agreed to front the cost and I was luckily able to befriend a grad student who later referred me into an overpaid tech job.   But this was more me being lucky than knowing what I was doing.
comment,Finances,positive,I also had to choose between Madison (in-state) and Michigan, I chose Michigan but often I wish I chose Madison. Tbh I think they're close enough that the extra cost of Michigan is not warranted, esp it you're planning on saving some money toward grad school  I even got pretty good aid here but I still pay more than I would have at Madison. I'm happy here and I do really like the school, but I also spend a lot of time feeling guilty that my parents are paying that much more in tuition.   Also, my parents definitely like having me closer to home, I didn't think that would be an important factor but it turns out it was (esp bc I have younger siblings).  Also, if you live in Wisconsin, it would be a lot more fun to rep Madison than rep Michigan. I never wear my Michigan stuff around here because (1) I don't want to seem like I'm flexing (2) everyone else wears Badgers gear and I'm not going to willingly identify myself as the enemy  Some of these are more minor points, but basically if I were to choose again, I would choose Madison (I can't speak to Purdue)
comment,Finances,positive,It depends what your major is, how seriously you take your academics and what Job you ultimately land. Not trying to offend people here, but if you‚Äôre majoring in a low paying field like gender studies, art, music, communications etc, it‚Äôs not worth the investment if you have to pay the tuition yourself. However, if you major in engineering, business, Econ, computer science etc, you‚Äôll probably make back the tuition in a few years considering some of our grads make 6 figures right out of college.      for me, it‚Äôs worth it because my job will pay a lot and i have a good gpa (didn‚Äôt screw around). For most though, they care more about the ‚Äúfun‚Äù and consequently they end up with a bad investment.      it comes down to how much you‚Äôre going to get out of it. Each person is different.

comment,Finances,positive,I'm in state, but I knocked out the first couple of years at a community college (Washtenaw Community College is affordable and makes it pretty easy to transfer credits) and then transferred when I was over 24 and could be counted as an independent student.
comment,Finances,positive,I'm lucky enough to have received a scholarship which covers all of my tuition. If I didn't have this scholarship I probably would have went somewhere else (i.e. Kettering or Lawrence tech)
comment,Finances,neutral,Mommy and daddy pay for it all
comment,Finances,positive,Joined the national guard (I‚Äôm in-state but would pay in-state tuition regardless bc of it). 18k a year takes care of tuition and there‚Äôs a monthly GI bill stipend of like 400-750 depending on your job, though I‚Äôm saving that for law school bc it turns into a sizeable housing allowance + 16k a year after deployment  Prolly gonna graduate in ‚Äò24 or ‚Äò25 tho (originally ‚Äò23/HS ‚Äò19) bc of gap year for training and likely deployment while some people go straight through so YMMV lol  In purely economical terms probably not worth the lost post-grad income if you‚Äôre already paying in-state tbh, but if you‚Äôre someone interested in serving regardless (like me) I‚Äôd say it was more than worth it  Plus if you go MP you might get to take fun mid-semester field trips to the capitol /s
comment,Finances,negative,I am an international student and pay nearly 35k for each semester. With living expense, it will add up to 40k per semester. I do have a high gpa, but can't apply for scholarship cuz no offers for international students. Thus, my dad pays for the tution, but feel so sorry for him to pay that much...
comment,Finances,positive,I got good aid. By far the cheapest school.  Where's the in state gang at?
comment,Finances,neutral,Loans, jobs, no sleep
comment,Finances,positive,I‚Äôm in state and I got generous aid, combination of grants and a scholarship. My parents pay the few thousand per year it doesn‚Äôt cover.  I had zero college fund and I come from a very middle class family (Not the bs where people are like ‚Äúwell my parents make $150k per year but I feel middle class.) If I hadn‚Äôt gotten such a good aid package I am not sure I would‚Äôve made it to university, or it would‚Äôve just been a hell of a lot of debt. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful I got the aid I did so I won‚Äôt have to live a lifetime of debt.
comment,Finances,positive,I‚Äôm in state. I went to community college for two years and transferred in after that. My family doesn‚Äôt qualify for any financial aid, so I take out loans to pay tuition (which honestly is still $11k a semester for engineering). Every summer I work 2+ jobs to save up enough money to pay rent all year. Even with this system, I‚Äôm still going to graduate with about $50k in debt :(
comment,Finances,neutral,I paid for my schooling with community College, loans, jobs and getting a few scholarships.
comment,Finances,neutral,In state and I got a few scholarships and my parents are paying for a little bit
comment,Finances,positive,I worked hard to get lots of merit scholarships from different places and my parents worked really hard to make sure that they had enough for me to go to college, bless em.
comment,Finances,positive,If you want to work a job (you definitely won't be able to cover all of your expenses, but it can help cover some of them) I would go to campus employers; if you do well enough in a class, a lot of times there are UTA/grader positions that are fairly well paid for pretty minimal work. Especially if some things are online and you can help with class and hold office hours remotely, then I would take advantage of that.
comment,Finances,positive,I‚Äôm gonna be honest. If I wasn‚Äôt in state there is no way I‚Äôd ever consider UofM over whatever my instate option is. No reason to go here for the extra cost
comment,Finances,neutral,If you're OOS getting $0 in aid or scholarships then you better have rich parents or you'll be absolutely crushed by debt
comment,Finances,positive,I went to community college before coming to Michigan. I would highly recommend doing that to save some cash and get a lot of your basics out of the way (especially if it is still virtual come fall). You can transfer up to 62 credit hours with an associate's degree, which covers about two years.   Well that and being an in state student. Tbh, Michigan really isn't *that* worth it for an OOS student given how expensive it is. But if you are dead set on UofM, then going to CC is a great way to cut your college debt in half.

comment,Finances,negative,Parents mortgaged their house and now me via loans since my parents lost their jobs. RIP
comment,Finances,positive,OOS, some aid, graduating in three years etc, but mostly just parents who‚Äôve been planning for this for three decades. I‚Äôm incredibly lucky and privileged.
comment,Finances,positive,OOS but poor enough to get good financial aid and a couple of scholarships so I get free tuition
post,Health / Wellness,negative,Hi all, I finally have the courage to post this. I'm a current UM student. I absolutely love UM and I wanted to continue my PhD study here. The professor who I wanted to work with wrote a strong recommendation letter for me, which made me feel it was promising to get in. But the program rejected me anyway.  Several hours after I received the rejection decision I had an appointment with my primary care physician. I was hurting so much that I couldn't stop crying in front of him. ‚ÄúI've tried my best, but in the end everything just doesn't matter‚Äù - that‚Äôs the only thought on my mind at that moment. He asked me if I was going to hurt myself. I said yes, without knowing the consequences of admitting that I felt suicidal. He sent me to the UM Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Service. I was interviewed by several staff. They decided to transfer me to a mental health unit of another hospital, aka. the psych ward. They kept me waiting in a chair from 6PM to 8AM the next day because no beds were available. I was transferred by an ambulance to the psych ward. Everyone there was seeing me as a breaking news. "Wow we got a UM student here!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would UM student be committed to the psych ward?" "UM students should be smart enough to navigate life crisis." While I surely didn‚Äôt feel I belonged there, I felt I had nowhere to go.  During the whole week while I was hospitalized, the staff took away all my personal belongings, including my phone and laptop. In other words, they cut off all my contact with the outside world. I could not text my friends, check my emails, or work on anything. I was begging for some books to read, but they didn't provide any. All they asked me to do was laying in my bed. So I lay in the bed crying for the whole week, missing my friends and missing myself - the self who dreamed to be a researcher.  You might be thinking the psychiatrist should be able to help me. The truth was that as long as I revealed any negative emotions or vulnerabilities, the psychiatrist would delay the discharge. I desperately wanted to get out of there and have my freedom back. So I pretended that I was perfectly fine, asking for a reevaluation and begging her for a discharge. Nevertheless, she kept me there for a week. I was diagnosed with depression.  You might be wondering why is getting rejected from a PhD program hurting so much. The answer is that I'm an international student. I depend on visa to stay here. My researcher personality means that I‚Äôm not suitable for real-world jobs. And it's really hard for international students to find a research assistant position without being in the F-1 status. The consequence of not being able to stay in the US means that I have to go back to my home country, dealing with my abusive family and the authoritarian regime. Furthermore, I would not be able to find a research position there because my research area is forbidden in my home country due to its politically sensitive nature. So I thought about taking my own life. But don't worry, I have been taking antidepressants for half a month now and I'm mentally stable.  I'm posting this because this is the most terrifying experience of my life. I'm terrified of the US mental health care system. The UM Hospital Psychiatric Emergency Service and the psych ward were very demeaning, apathetic, abusive, and retraumatizing. Because they are under the guise of medical treatment, they can easily commit human rights violations without getting caught or having proper litigation. This experience just discourages me from seeking help for mental health in the future. Someday I might feel really suicidal, but I wouldn't tell anyone because I'm afraid of being sent to the psych ward again.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,As an international student who one day hope to apply to a PhD program and is also riddled with mental health issues, I extend my deepest sympathies.  I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that. I know psych wards are cruel places but my personal experience is that not all mental health services are like that.   I know in some cultures anything less than the best is not good enough, but if it‚Äôs primarily a problem of maintaining your visa status, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with applying to less prestigious schools.  Don‚Äôt give up on applying to other programs, and don‚Äôt give up on your mental health! You‚Äôre worth it.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thank you so much for sharing your story.  This was very courageous of you and although I don‚Äôt know you I‚Äôm very proud of you for doing so. I don‚Äôt know if you mentioned this but I think if you have the ability to get a regular therapist it might be a more consistent outlet and it might give your feelings a place to exist without feeling scared of the result of sharing them.   Please always tell someone if you‚Äôre feeling suicidal, I know that may sound preachy but I think in the long run it‚Äôs worth it. I don‚Äôt know how many other schools you applied to but like someone else mentioned I think you should cast a wide net.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Fellow international student here. I am so sorry this has happened to you.   **As for continuing as a researcher, here are some things you can do**  1. F-1 Visa students are ***entitled*** to 1 year of OPT, optional practical training. Use that to apply to work under your professor as a researcher, full time if you can. When I was getting rejected left right and center from PhD programs, this is what I had as a backup plan. My friend did it too, as did another friend. It worked out for my friends who weren't able to get PhD positions at first. 2. Your additional year of research time (especially full time, with papers published) will strengthen your application a lot. Even if you cannot continue at UofM other schools will very likely consider you. Even if you don't have papers published, having successfully participated in research full time will give you many advantages over other applicants. (It is one thing to be a good student, it is another to be a proven researcher.) 3. Even if the above is no longer tangible, there are other post bach programs that can allow you to extend your time in the US, although it will be expensive. While you are in those programs, try point 2.  This should serve as a "warning" to other international students, as unhealthy as it sounds: when talking about your feelings, NEVER talk about wanting to hurt yourself. It has gotten students (in other school) visa canceled. (Yeah I know this is not healthy, but this is our reality as international students.) The mental health system, should look into this though.  Lastly, (this part is a rant) our position as international students mean we simply do not enjoy as many privilege as our American peers. I am afraid to tell my advisors I have encountered mental health problems and my productivity has dropped. American students can probably arrange something with the school and advisors because they are under no threat of getting kicked out of the country. Also when we encounter unfair practices (like you on the ward), our only choice is to endure. Sometimes life here feels like this quote:  " ...*and all five times I was compelled by honor to fight in strange places, far away from relatives or¬†friends and without anything to rely upon besides God, the Art, myself, Fiore, and my sword. By the grace of God, I came¬†through each time with my honor intact and without any physical injuries.*" - Fiore dei Liberi
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Thank you so much for sharing. As a fellow former U of M student, I too was sent to the psych ward after having breakdowns upon breakdowns during my second year. I understand what you went through. PM me if you ever want to chat.   Edit: actually, please do PM me. I would love to talk more about this and other details if you don't mind.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I am so sorry that you went through all of that. I‚Äôm glad you are still here today.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,My deepest fear is being committed to a psych ward, unable to get out and not having anyone believe me that I don't belong there.  I've been afraid of it since I was 12. I'm so sorry that happened to you, it sounds terrible.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Being trapped in a mental health facility is one of my biggest fears. Im glad you made it out and you are still here. When I was working for the U, I had to go to court mandated therapy. Dealing with the stress in your life can be difficult. If you are an intelligent person, there are a lot of problems that you feel you can solve on your own. But we all need help sometimes. For me, it was important to get an outside perspective. We can't always see ourselves objectively and sometimes we convince ourselves of things simply aren't true. Anyway, I think the most important thing I can say is that you are not alone in this. The feeling of rejection definitely hurts and your pain is real. There are others who have gotten through similar situations and some still struggling. You definitely should not feel like a lesser person because of this and I'm sure you are inspiring others with your openness.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that, it seems awful. I‚Äôm sure it was also hard to share your story, but you could truly help people by raising awareness about the treatment you received. I wish you the best in your recovery.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,UM psychiatric is absolutely terrible and I've personally had terrible experiences with them. Makes my blood boil. So sorry things have been hard in your life - please don't harm yourself; you have a lot to live for and things will turn around!
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,I‚Äôm so furious at the system here. How the fuck could anyone think that putting a mentally unstable person in a psych ward is a good idea. The psychiatrists seem just as thick as they were many years ago when they used electroshock therapy to cure homosexuality... I‚Äôm actually curious about this, so if anyone with some more knowledge supports the current system I‚Äôm curious as to why you do
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,This is why I like Reddit. We are free to express our real thoughts and feelings here without fear of being mistreated or judged. As I read this I felt whatever minor or major emotional release OP must‚Äôve felt in and after writing this. Thanks for sharing this and I wish you all the best and know you will press on. By posting this here for all to see you have taken the first step in pressing on and I think you should try MiskatonicDreams‚Äô suggestions, and not lose hope.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I am so sorry about what you have gone through. I also failed at several university applications so I share your feelings, although those were probably not as severe.   As an international student here at UM (once, I graduated), I do share the pressure. As a master's student, I was constantly anxious and sometimes maniac about how I have already cost my family a fortune and what would that mean if I couldn't land a job. My family is not rich... I also know quite a few Ph.D. friends who got stuck in their research and finally decided to quit after 3 years into the program. One of them, as far as I know, has been on anti-depressants for over a year. And unfortunately, she also shares your view of not finding the mental health service really helpful. :(   On the upside, they went back to their home countries and seem to be quite happy about life now. One of them started over another Ph.D. degree in another university and the others landed jobs. Life goes on. I know it hurts to fail but as other comments suggested if your primary goal was to keep your visa, try other schools.  Life as an international here can be tough. The snow is beautiful but the winter is depressing for me coming from a tropical city (and with all the exams and project dues). Schools and applications may not work out and policies can change all the time and get even less favorable. I am pretty sure I was once on the brink of collapse after one of those Thanksgiving holidays. Feeling much better now but that level of anxiety can cause terrible flashbacks sometimes.   I personally find getting a pet helps. My two little fur kids (cats) really cheer me up sometimes. And the feeling of companionship really helps when living alone. :)
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,‚ÄúUM students should be smart enough to navigate life crisis‚Äù came from someone working in psychiatry? I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in the right profession.
comment,Health / Wellness,neutral,I hope you are able to use the strategies other commenters have mentioned to stay here through research and reapplying, etc.   I can say that while I love U of M, my own experience with the university‚Äôs mental health resources, while not as extreme, were quite bad and were responsible for some of my worst memories of my time there. So you are not alone in that regard.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,>The truth was that as long as I revealed any negative emotions or vulnerabilities, the psychiatrist would delay the discharge. I desperately wanted to get out and to have my freedom back. So I pretended that I was perfectly fine, asking for a reevaluation and begging her for a discharge. Nevertheless, she kept me there for a week. I was diagnosed with depression.  This makes my blood boil as a former Psych major. This psychiatrist doesn't give a shit. You **never** diagnose someone when the behavior can be explained by external factors. Getting rejected from a Ph.D program is a huge fucking external factor. This is basic Psych 101, that psychiatrist is incompetent as hell. Furthermore, meds are a short-term, band-aid fix that aren't designed to be a solution - they're just pill-pushing because they don't care about providing actual help.  Lazy, incompetent people in that Psych Ward.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I‚Äôm very sorry to hear you had to experience this. If you are willing and able, there are a lot of therapists outside the scope of the university that don‚Äôt have to blindly follow the strict rules and regulations.  Hearing your story is deeply upsetting. This isn‚Äôt the first, nor the second, but the *third* story i have heard within the past two years of the psych ward creating more problems, trauma, and medical bills for the people they claim to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù and ‚Äúcare about‚Äù.   I know of someone who has a legitimate case of an ADA violation and they got back to them basically saying ‚Äúwe investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong, sorry you‚Äôre SOL‚Äù. UM Psychiatric is a disgrace to the university, and it‚Äôs a disgrace to mental health care. I hope something changes soon
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,I am so sorry to hear about the pain you had to go through. Thank you for sharing your story; it takes a lot of strength.  I am also an international grad student intending to apply for a PhD this year, and your story hit too close to home. Having dealt with mental health issues in the past (in my home country), this truly feels like nightmare fuel. Currently even my stay here for masters is under question, as my funding doesn‚Äôt extend to next year and getting a GSI position as an MA is hard. So I feel you.  Please stay strong, and don‚Äôt hesitate to DM if you need to talk to someone.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,the psych ward threatened to sedate me because i got upset they wouldn‚Äôt let me charge my phone, and the only reason i was there was to sober up. they also told me i hallucinated my trauma that made me get so upset i ended up there.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Medication can help in near term, but most depression symptoms are caused by social events. To resolve the issue, we need life change. For example, you are accepted by a different PhD program, you get a job offer, you fell better interest and financially free.   I was a passionate researcher at UM. Because I believe integrity, reported scientific misconducts by others in the internal medicine department, I got retaliated by Dr. Dick Simon and HR. I was depressed and hospitalized and fired. The University does not allow me to reapply any position associated with the University, I get more depressed. But, at this time, the psychiatric department decides stop my outpatient treatments because UM legal department does not allow.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,Reading this made me so angry...I'm so sorry.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,First, I'm very sorry about what you went through.  Second: The University of Michigan is a terrific university. If you had a good shot of getting in there, maybe you'd have an easy time getting into a weak grad school.  Here's a list of some grad schools with rolling admissions:  https://www.gradschools.com/get-informed/before-you-apply/choosing-where-study/grad-schools-rolling-admissions  The University of Pittsburgh, for example, seems to have doctoral programs. My understanding is that that's a really nice place to be.
comment,Health / Wellness,negative,I'm so sorry this happened to you; I've been through this too. Suicidal thoughts are de-facto illegal, and that's a hushed thing and a very controversial for me to say. (Hence this throwaway account.)  1. NEVER tell a medical professional you're thinking of hurting yourself; NEVER call the suicide hotline and provide your information. You'll be put in custody for an indeterminate amount of time without access to professional help. 2. Instead, say that you have depression and can't take it any more. Anything except suicide. (Blame the insurance companies that control health care.) 3. The psych ward at UMich is tiny and the emergency room acts as a holding pen. Because they do not have the resources to help you, or most people, it's in your best interest to pretend you're better and convince the head psych you feel better. He'll (it was a "he" in my case) see through your lie but knows the shitty situation at the psych ward and may let you out to make room. 4. You may have to wait 12-36 hours to see a doctor in the psych e.r. while you sit there. Incredible, isn't it? 5. You can't leave. They put a tracking bracelet on you in that little room and there are cops at the exit. 6. This is terrifying, I know. It's also very painful physically since there is no where to lay down and the seats are built into the wall and have partitions. You've come here for help, and instead you're put into physical and mental anguish for hours without any respite. 7. This is why suicides spike after psych ward visits. 8. The United States, despite the talk of confronting widespread mental disease, does not invest resources into mental health. In fact, over my lifetime we've closed those facilities. 9. If you have health issues, you may want to consider leaving the United States after you complete your eduction. Parts of the country are collapsing. 10. If you find yourself in psych ward custody for more than 24 hours, start acting out in the waiting room non-violently and they'll put you in a room with a bed and try to fetch a doctor while you can rest, even if they cuff you.

post,Housing,negative,I'm looking to rent a house from this company, and I love the place, but I'm a little sketched out by the company. Apparently they've changed names twice, they don't have many reviews online, and the ones I could find were either bad or possibly fake. I could only find one thread about it on Reddit with not much information. Has anyone rented from this company?
comment,Housing,positive,Lived in one of Dan‚Äôs Houses in roughly 2015. House was a slum, but it was ridiculously cheap so we kinda knew what we were getting into. Never really interacted with the management so can‚Äôt say how they would‚Äôve been. Dan brought Insomnia cookies to the lease signing and I think he might‚Äôve been pretty high lol
comment,Housing,positive,Lived in one of Dan‚Äôs for a summer ‚Äòcus, yeah, cheap. We never really had any dramatic issues so I never really dealt with Management, but yeah, the place was sorta not great overall. Our rooms and the living room were solid but like the bathroom/kitchen/basement were shite.   Also, for some reason, the sole stairwell to the basement had a locking mechanism on the outside, which, as someone who has never really wanted to keep prisoners in a basement dungeon before, struck me as kind of an odd feature, lol
comment,Housing,positive,First two are both reputable- haven‚Äôt heard of the third. Lived in a Jones place before and know people who have lived in Dan‚Äôs Houses places as well.
post,COVID-19,positive,Does anyone know if there are study spots available for use after like 10pm? I really like studying in the Dude, but it closes at 8pm. Thanks for any recommendations
comment,COVID-19,positive,I'm a pretty big fan of the Blue Lounge in the basement of GG Brown. It's room 1280, got some vending machines, a microwave, outlets, a printer, really close bathrooms, etc. If you're an engineering student, GG Brown is open 24/7, if not, your M-card will stop working for the building at midnight (although the lounge itself doesn't require special access, so as long as you don't lock yourself out of the building you'll be fine)
comment,COVID-19,positive,Reserve a study room and then just stay there late. MH is usually good for this. Just don‚Äôt let the door of your room shut behind you or else you might get locked out. This is for central campus though. I don‚Äôt know about north
comment,COVID-19,neutral,north campus
post,Finances,negative,Back in ancient history, 1990 when I was attending U of M, a semester's tuition was $2,000. I went over to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and found out that with inflation, that $2k would now be $4,106.47.  I then went to U o M's prospective student page and found a semester of in-state tuition is now $17,522.   What the fuck U of M?
comment,Finances,negative,As an in-stater I‚Äôve just stopped complaining about tuition cause the OOS tuition is ridiculous
comment,Finances,negative,That number is for the whole year, not semester. Either way it is ridiculous still!
comment,Finances,negative,More like, what the fuck Michigan (and every other state) state legislature? The graph in this article shows the steep decline in appropriations for higher ed in Michigan over time. Operating costs have to come from somewhere.   https://www.mlive.com/education/2013/03/report_shows_michigan_high_for.html

comment,Finances,neutral,that's just american university baby
comment,Finances,positive,This article from 2010 says Michigan was $3.5K for the year (inflation adjusted would be $7K now) while EMU was $2K in 1990.

I went to university in the early 2000s and didn't realize how much it's even jumped since then until reading here: [https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/09/what\_many\_older\_people\_dont\_re.html](https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/09/what_many_older_people_dont_re.html)

post,COVID-19,negative,I‚Äôm so sick of everyone saying that we might not be back in the fall, we‚Äôll still need to wear masks and social distance. Cases have fallen by 300% in the past month and it‚Äôs only going to get better. Mark my words, we will be back to normal by the fall. Probably even a fully open 4th of July. Stop being so happy with this quarantine and isolation and stop being so negative  This was in response to a post asking if we‚Äôd be back to normal in Winter 2022. Yes 2022. Absurd and then people commented and said they weren‚Äôt sure
comment,COVID-19,positive,In the recent town hall, Biden pushed that estimate to the end of July. Still optimistic though
comment,COVID-19,negative,This. I don't know why people are so fixated on this way of life. Things are looking up but everyone wants to be a doomer and continue pushing unnecessary fear
comment,COVID-19,positive,I saw this comment on r/Coronavirus:    At the CURRENT pace (1.64 million a day) the U.S. should be able to vaccinate 80% of its entire ADULT population by the end of July.  If they can increase that number to 2.5 million a day (J&J will help) they can move that date to end of May.  Regardless, vaccinating the entire country (75%+) will most likely take 5 to 6 months.  The issue is that right now there‚Äôs more a problem with supply where in a few months it will be more with demand. Even then, there‚Äôs a decent amount of people who won‚Äôt want it at all, but that shouldn‚Äôt really make a difference in the long term. I think we‚Äôll start to open up during the summer and be pretty close to fully open in the fall (still masks and distancing).
comment,COVID-19,neutral,Remind me! 6 months
comment,COVID-19,positive,Tbh I would love a normal fall semester but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs  gonna happen because safety measures will most likely still be in place and classrooms aren‚Äôt big enough to social distance and in my opinion it‚Äôs very unlikely that social distancing requirements will go away in 2021
comment,COVID-19,positive,because july is unrealistic  your looking at September if lucky the world is also now surging again
comment,COVID-19,neutral,[deleted]
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I agree, we will reach a point where the costs of isolation are greater than the risks of covid once enough people are getting vaccinated, so even if us young college kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated by then I think we will still reopen

post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm an incoming freshman this year, and I've received an email to make my uniqname. I figure it's supposed to be some combination of your first and last name or something, but I'm not sure what to use. What did you guys make it?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Whatever you decide to make it, keep in mind that this is going to be your professional email/ID for many years to come ‚Äî this is what your professors will see on the course rosters, what prospective employers are going to see at recruiting events, etc. Choose a professional option; ideally, one that‚Äôs easy to recognize you by (some combination of last name and first name or initial).
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,One of my econ teachers got rabbit as his uniqname
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Don't pick something dumb, no matter how tempting.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,The most common thing is first initial, last name.   I used jsmith, if my name were John Smith. I highly recommend this if it‚Äôs possible for you. It is the single best choice.   You could also go just last name, first name last initial if your last name is too long, first initial middle initial last name, and so on.  If people have a really long last name, like Worthington, they might go jworth or something like that.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I just set mine as my last name, which is uncommon enough that nobody else had claimed it before.  Fun fact: There is a law professor at Umich who has the Uniqname of "Nimrod." The story goes that, as an 18-year-old freshman, he thought it'd be funny to set that as his name. He graduated from undergrad, went to their law school, and eventually became one of their professors - and still carries the name Nimrod to this day.  Yes, it *can* be changed, but it's a lengthy system that can leave your emails a bit spazzy for a couple of months, so it wasn't feasible for him to do so.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Like everyone else is saying, keep it professional and make sure it includes aspects of your name.   But on a side note, im always sad that I didn't make mine 3 characters when I created it. My initials were open as a valid uniqname and I with I went with it.  So if you can get a 3 letter uniqname that can identify you and is professional, I'd go with that.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,mine is my whole last name followed by the first two letters of my first name. So if my name was Jane Doe, my uniquename is doeja.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I toyed around with first/last name combinations, but they were all taken or ugly. So, I went with a mesh of my first and middle name since it actually sounded nice and was decently professional.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Also in the event you chose a uniqname that‚Äôs a little embarrassing/nonprofessional a solution I‚Äôve heard mentioned a few times was to make a email group like clubs do but then only add yourself to it and then give that out for professional stuff. It won‚Äôt change your username for university stuff but it could prevent the event of having to put an embarrassing name down for other things.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Choose wisely. If you then go on to work here, the uniqname stays with you. Forever. Hard to almost impossible to change.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,If your first name is not already in the uniqname system, then claim it!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It can honestly be anything you want but most people just do something with their name since it‚Äôs not likely to have been taken by someone else.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Pick something that stands out, is professional and easy to remember/recognize. For me, my first name is really unique (Maximos) so I just used that + my last names first initial. Really anything works though just don't do smrh cringe
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I went with just firstnamelastname since that was only 8 letters long and unique
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I did first name followed by the first letter of my last name  I know some people with uncommon enough names to just have their first name be their uniqname
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Wait, you guys got to choose yours? I was assigned one and was told I had to deal with it.

post,COVID-19,neutral,Anyone know the reasoning?
comment,COVID-19,positive,Graduation isn't strictly necessary, it would promote people who generally aren't on campus (families) to attend, and the vast majority of students are not back on campus.
comment,COVID-19,positive,Since when are the ‚Äúvast majority of students back on campus‚Äù? That isn‚Äôt true at all
comment,COVID-19,neutral,An in person graduation ceremony isn't necessary for the business of the university in the way that holding classes is.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,If you want to read through a similar discussion from last week:   https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/ldqvfp/change_my_mind/
comment,COVID-19,positive,students are not back on campus. Dorms are closed unless students demonstrated a need. Students who have private residences off campus that the university has zero control over may or may not be back in those houses.   Also, the physical act of graduation may not be excessively dangerous, but if you have graduation, you‚Äôre directly incentivizing thousands of family members from worldwide to travel to and from Ann Arbor, along with the huge increase in parties that will happen.
comment,COVID-19,positive,yes
post,Prospective Student,positive,I'm a propective student who has just applied to Umich this application cycle and I'm wondering, is taking a gap year possible if I were accepted?   I've been wanting to do a gap year for a bit of time now. I think it would be hugely beneficial in getting some work experience, help out the family and hone-in my hobbies for a year. I don't think I can handle jumping straight into college because of 1) academic burn-out, 2) mental burn-out (anxiety), 3) I want some cushion time for me to figure out what I want to do with my life. I definitely think that my love of learning has been drained out of me and I think time away will definitely revive this enthusiasm and appreciation once I'm back at school. I also think I would take better advantage of the resources at school if my goals are more clear (not boutta drop serious cash if I won't be able to make the best use of it).  Has anyone sucessfully requested a gap year and gone through with one? What was your experience in requesting one and planning for one? Would I be able to get one if I wanted to work for a year and to improve my anxiety? People describe me as a highly motivated person so I know I won't be that kid  that didn't return to school after taking a gap year.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Michigan technically considers this a deferment of enrollment, rather than a gap year, but it‚Äôs definitely possible and is often granted.  https://umich.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41/~/deferment-of-admission  I recommend going into a gap year with a structured plan for what you want to do, even if it‚Äôs not that in-depth. Don‚Äôt spend it at home on the couch. It would also be a good time to see a mental health professional, because it‚Äôs difficult entering an elite university while struggling with mental health.   I don‚Äôt think you should be cocky about your motivation to return to school next year just because you‚Äôre ‚Äúhighly motivated‚Äù, though. While you‚Äôll likely feel ready to go back, be deliberate about returning to college.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You can defer your admission by one year and it is pretty simple to get to my knowledge. I'm currently on a gap year (incoming freshman) and it's been one of the best decisions I've made so far considering how the current school year is playing out. One of the problems I ran into was my plans not really coming to fruition cause of COVID and I had to scramble to find things to do. While it is nice to have a plan, things can change all the time so don't be dead set on something very specific.   Be warned, you have a lot of free time and will forget pretty much everything you learned in high school unless you practice it. Seems obvious but I wish I could bash past me for my lackluster attitude. I also thought I was highly motivated when I started the gap year, telling myself I would learn how to program, slay my math textbooks, and become a god with excel. Skip to the present and I gave up on programming, did maybe 2 chapters total of math, and haven't touched excel. On the other hand I learned more about myself as a person, dropped my ego, and figured out what made me genuinely happy. Don't set unrealistic goals, but always have something you're working towards else you will just waste time. I second the idea of not being a couch potato. Hope this helps.
post,Class,positive,I know this is probably the 100th post about Umich math, but I feel super stressed out. There's an exam in Math 116 next Monday, and I feel behind in a vast majority of the concepts. I feel like my GSI is a really good person, but she just cannot teach so I don't want to talk bad about her personally. It stresses me out because she clearly has good intentions, but I don't understand what she's trying to get and a lot of my peers feel the same. The exam is in like 5-6 days, and here I am struggling to understand what integration by parts, which is supposed to be easy according to her. My mental health is also low due to quarantine and I'm trying to stay confident, but there's always a point that no matter how much confidence you have, you eventually just breakdown mentally. I don't want to affirm the stereotype of "avoid Umich math!" bc clearly if you put your effort in it, it shouldn't be that bad. However, I didn't put my heart in the beginning of the semester like I did in math 115, and now here I am confused about most of the concepts.
comment,Class,neutral,I can explain integration by parts to you if you want
comment,Class,negative,Watch videos online, read the textbook, and do the textbook problems (look up answers w/ explanation online). For Calc I-III a lot of the material is standardized across the board so you can get away with learning from different sources as long as you know which topics are covered. As with Michigan math, as a math major I can say that in my personal experience, Michigan math department can be inconsistent with instructor quality (hit greatly or miss badly). I‚Äôve had professors/GSI‚Äôs that were soo good I barely had to crack open the textbook. On the other hand I also had some that were soo bad (reading directly from textbook or going too fast, or messy notation/ illegible writing...) it was much better to just read the textbook and do the exercises. It varies a lot and some great professors are also struggling due to covid as they are not used to teaching via tablet on Zoom. Just hang on and try looking up lectures/ notes from other uni‚Äôs online and read the textbook.
comment,Class,positive,I also felt like I really didn't understand the concepts when I took it last semester. patrickjmt on YouTube helped me a lot when I took Math 116. He has a video on integration by parts and videos on all the Math 116 concepts so you should definitely check it out.    There was a question on exam 2 that was an exact replica of a team hw question but just different numbers, so I literally just copied my team homework answer. Make sure you have your team homework questions/answers handy if they still allow you to use physical notes.  My GSI wasn't the best either, so I relied on the past exam questions to prepare for exams. Honestly that class is such a pain in the ass and it always stressed me out. My advice would be to practice exam questions (even if it's just 1 or 2) after you learn the concepts because there are only so many questions that they test you on. There were some concepts that I didn't even understand but I was able to get them right because they followed a similar method to past exam questions. Anyways good luck on your test, I'm sure you'll do great!
comment,Class,neutral,What helped me with integration by parts was the LIATE rule (meaning when choosing what u is, first do logs, then inverse trig, algebraic (polynomials), trig, and lastly exponentials.
comment,Class,negative,Idk if 116 does this, but most classes have all the profs/gsis post their lectures. If they do this in 116 just watch the recording of a different gsi rather than sitting in a bad lecture.
comment,Class,positive,Im sorry to hear you are stressed. One thing that may help would be going to the Math Lab. Not only will the tutors there help you with individual problems, but they can also explain to you concepts, like integration by parts.
comment,Class,positive,Honestly it's embarrassing to say but for me "Calculus II for Dummies" was the best 10 dollars I ever spent, so easy to read and explained the concepts so clearly and intuitively, and that made the material accessible enough for me to get enthusiastic and really apply myself and finish strong. Also like somebody else said, there are great youtube channels for all the topics, for standardized classes (calculus, physics, chemistry) I found it a huge help to hear the material from a couple different sources, sometimes your lecturer is someone whose teaching style really "clicks" with your learning style, but sometimes that's not the case. That's ok, it doesn't mean anything's wrong with you or them, it just means you might want to adjust your strategy for the course. Good luck!
comment,Class,neutral,Some other students and I've made a study sheet. DM if you want a copy of it. It explains all of the concepts and has some tips.
comment,Class,neutral,Does her last name start with an M?
post,COVID-19,positive,Starting off I know it is too early to call want to hear what you guys thinking   I am planning to transfer over by winter and am working towpaths it but from viewing this sub and everything going on with Covid I am genuinely debating since it seems the students here from covid are just treated horribly. I just genuinely don‚Äôt know if the consensus is that it will stay the same or go back to how it was for fall 20 with less restrictions if it will even be worth it. I want to go to a place that respects me or makes me think I am respected especially during this time because PEOPLE MATTER MORE THAN MY SCHOOL OR STATUS.  TLDR: do you think school will be mostly open in winter 22 and is it worth transferIng if not fully open. Respect Yourself
comment,COVID-19,positive,Seems very well possible, will see how vaccines go.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I think in Fall 2021 we‚Äôll have mainly in person‚Äôs but still socially distancing and wearing masks
comment,COVID-19,neutral,It will most likely be open in the fall, being how there's been mostly 0 transmission of covid through classrooms
comment,COVID-19,positive,Yeah very high probability
comment,COVID-19,positive,Lol I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre seriously asking this. Yes we will be back to normal in the Fall
post,Employment,positive,Does anybody know of a good place to apply or more places to apply to for cs internships? Ive applied everywhere and I dont even hear back from 90% of them, its so demoralizing. Anybody who got internships pls give me tips I feel like im running out of time for this summer
comment,Employment,neutral,It is demoralizing, but you just need to keep applying. I used the PittCSC github list of internships and applied to 150 internships and got 2 offers.
comment,Employment,positive,If you‚Äôre only applying to giant companies, you should consider applying more regionally/ locally. For example I had a friend summer between freshman and sophomore year do a CS internship at a credit union in west Michigan.  There‚Äôs hundreds of people applying to Apple and google. There‚Äôs probably less then 50 people applying to anything small town local.  Also have someone review your resume, even if it‚Äôs just like a subreddit for resume reviews, there maybe some real obvious formatting issues that are getting your resume tossed by ATS software
comment,Employment,positive,I think aiming for small startups is the way to go since their recruiting timelines are less standard.  I recommend reaching out to startup founders/Csuite execs at this point in the summer with a tailored LinkedIn message/request since you‚Äôll probably get a higher response rate. Lmk if you need an example.
comment,Employment,neutral,Apply to MiHIN (Michigan Health Information Network) for their software developer intern position. They won't even require a coding interview (mainly behavioral).
comment,Employment,positive,dude you have to network. Majority of people who don‚Äôt have someone pulling for them will not even make it to an interview. I‚Äôm not sure what CS does, but I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall have networking events and alumni to reach out to. its very very difficult to get a position at a company if you have no network there. You have to attend OCR events and try to get alumni or family friends who work at a software company to get you an internship
post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi everyone. I'm currently a high school senior. I've gotten accepted to LSA, and if I choose to attend U of M, I'll be doing premed with a Microbiology major. I just want to know: how good is it? Are there sufficient volunteering/research/internship opportunities in the campus or in the nearby Ann Arbor area? Do the classes prepare you well for the MCAT? Are there any other activities in U of M that might enhance my medical school application?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Hey! I'm a current med student who did undergrad at Michigan.  >how good is it?    I mean that's subjective. It's impossible for any of us to know how well you would do as an individual, as some thrive and excel, while others will find it extremely challenging. In my opinion, I was pretty satisfied with my education at UMich and I feel like it has prepared me well for medical school.  I've had some mediocre professors here but I've also had some really incredible lecturers that I can attribute my success to.   >Are there sufficient volunteering/research/internship opportunities in the campus or in the nearby Ann Arbor area?    More than enough. One of the huge advantages of Michigan is the fact that the medical school/hospital is right next door, so there are plenty of volunteering/research opportunities for you to pursue. I can say that at the medical school I go to right now, the undergrad is a 40-minute train ride away, whereas at Michigan it's literally a 10 minute walk. Especially with research, UMich's med school/hospital is really highly regarded. Also just FYI most premeds don't do internships, but a lot of people do summer programs/research/study abroad. Another huge advantage is that it's a huge student population, including graduate programs, so there are more than enough research opportunities for everybody, you just have to put in the work to find it.    The only thing I remember that was difficult to obtain was shadowing (but this may be a universal thing, not a Michigan thing), but it is still possible.   >Do the classes prepare you well for the MCAT?    In my opinion, most do yes. I felt especially prepared for Chemistry, given how rigorous the classes here were. All other subjects too except for E&M Physics. But regardless of how well prepared you are from the classes you do have to put in a good amount of self-study work to do well on the MCAT.    > Are there any other activities in U of M that might enhance my medical school application?    I mean what looks good on a med school application are you exceling in things you are passionate about. It's not like college application where you can say that you were in NHS or Key Club or w/e and that "checks" a box for them. Unless you're doing some prestigious fellowship or are a D1 athlete or something along those lines, what's gonna get you in are 1) good GPA/MCAT, 2) good Personal Statement (your "Why Medicine" essay) and Letters of Recommendations, and 3) ECs that show your passions. You do have to do some check boxing for medical school (clinical volunteering, non-clinical volunteering, shadowing, research, etc.), but you can take those in a variety of ways that show your interest in what you are doing. Being a cookie-cutter applicant makes it very difficult (not impossible) to get into medical school.   This is all just my opinion FYI so do take with a grain of salt.  Hope that helps and lmk if you have other questions!
post,Parking,positive,I can't really find much details on this. Is it just an indoor parking lot? Is it worth going for over Grad housing Parking?
comment,Parking,positive,It‚Äôs outdoor parking up on north campus. Mainly for undergrads who aren‚Äôt eligible for good parking passes
post,Research,positive,A couple of my friends and I are working on a solution to streamline the engineering career fair experience: both in-person and online versions. We think both versions of career fair are inefficient and inequitable, and we're in the works of designing a better experience to pitch to the college (and maybe other colleges too, if it's well-received).  Anyway, we just want to get some antidotes and opinions regarding what people think about engineering career fair in general (What works well and what doesn't? What do you love and what do you hate about it? etc.).  Feel free to comment here on your experiences! It would be great if you could include your class standing and major as well.  If you'd prefer to fill out a survey instead, here's a link to some guided questions that will help us develop this application: [https://forms.gle/3nTWoav6io25fuun9](https://forms.gle/3nTWoav6io25fuun9)  (We will give out 2 $10 Amazon gift cards at random among those that complete the survey.)  The engineering career fair is a great opportunity and we're excited to have the chance to make it better. Thanks for your help!
comment,Research,positive,This last career fair I didn't even get a chance to schedule a slot to talk to any companies. I think some way to extend the window for signup so its not just like a first-come-grab-all situation would be a good start
comment,Research,positive,Do the career fairs even matter?  I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs gotten anywhere beyond handing a recruiter a resume at a career fair.

post,Student Organization,positive,I've been doing some research on an animator whose animations are lost. I saw one of his short animations screened at Lightworks Fall 2011. It's called "Mike and Melissa Hang Out With A Squirrel". Are there any FVSA members that can check if there's a hard drive with the past Lightworks films? I am very interested in seeing this animation. Thanks!
post,Employment,positive,I am a sophomore with no work experience help.  Do not tell me that UMich website. They keep asking for graduate students. Or to have xyz experience when I don‚Äôt have any. Just any remote job please... or any other general remote job links would be nice. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be through UMich I don‚Äôt know where to search
comment,Employment,positive,I got my lab research job by looking on the umich website, specifically searching for research lab positions and reaching out to the prof conducting the research. I had no experience prior and I work completely remotely. If I were you, I would try and find research labs that interest you and just email the prof to see if they‚Äôre looking to hire.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hello! I recently got admitted to U of M, and I was filling out some forms and wanted to know -- when do seniors usually graduate? I read about the Fall, Winter, and Summer terms and I know it depends on the number of credits to an extent but in general, how does it work?  Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I feel like most students graduate in Winter. I‚Äôm graduating this summer. If the form is asking approximately when you‚Äôll graduate, you can always change your graduation term on Wolverine Access so it‚Äôs okay if you need more time.

post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,*looks around nervously* Can I say I think this is a good thing without everyone assuming I‚Äôm running Weiser‚Äôs re-election campaign?   Vaccine distribution *is* getting better. Yes, rollout has been slow but manufacturing new things is hard and gets better with time. Just this morning [Moderna said](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-us-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update-0) they will have shipped 100 million doses to the US market by end of March and 50 million doses every month after that. Pfizer indicated roughly the same timeline last week. Together that means at least 400 million doses for the US market by end of May even without any further vaccines approved.  The only part that worries me is the statement that Fall semester ‚Äúhinges on vaccines‚Äù. Vaccines are a powerful tool but current iterations may not work effectively against emerging variants and there‚Äôs a lot more we could be putting in place *now* to ensure/hasten a return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù: giving students masks that don‚Äôt suck, allowing small groups to reserve classrooms and other large spaces, heated outdoor tents once the weather gets better in a month, improving the testing program to get results within 12-24 hours instead of 24-48, just to name a few. Even the Hulk needs help from the other Avengers sometimes.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Fall is so far away and I don‚Äôt get why so many people in this thread are so confident we wont be able to go back in person. We obviously can‚Äôt be sure that it will happen either but it‚Äôs way more likely than the comments here imply.  Either way this is just PR mumbo jumbo that they‚Äôll repeat until we have a better picture of how vaccine distribution is going.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,After reading this article it doesn't really say anything except they hope things will be normal. But normalcy is dependent on vaccine distribution which the university has mentioned it is struggling a bit.  It would be more assuring if they had a better basis but right now this is a wish
comment,Academics - Other Topics,negative,Damage control.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Of course the regents would want to open up in fall. They tried to push us into in person last fall lmao
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,As long as they don‚Äôt mandate vaccines I won‚Äôt mind.
post,COVID-19,negative,F  I could complain about the numerous assignments that will be due the day after or my rapidly deteriorating mental health, but everyone feels the same so I'll just say F.  &#x200B;  We'll make it even if it's hard!
comment,COVID-19,positive,Need a mental wellness month at this point
comment,COVID-19,positive,My lab assignments are still due on both ‚Äúwellness days‚Äù and we are told to still go to lab on those days if we need to (which everyone would need to unless they cram into a different lab section)
comment,COVID-19,positive,I couldn‚Äôt agree more. My personal opinion is that the school did us no favors by extending our break period. What it did was basically shove our projected workload into a tighter window, forcing professors to give us more. The long break gave us a false sense of relaxation and then for those who were previously burnt out, they then lack no motivation to continue. The 2 mental health days are no more than political bs that the university can claim to make them seem more humane, but in reality they aren‚Äôt giving or doing us much of a favor because of the work we will already be doing on those days anyways!   Signed a burnt out senior
comment,COVID-19,positive,3 classes at UM and 2 at community college was a terrible idea... While working 40+ hours, almost died yesterday on the highway cause someone decided to rear end me and drove off while my car was spinning (I'm fine, car is fine lol)   I'm glad my community college has a one week break, but I'm about this close smashing my face into the moniter, cause 2 degrees is not fun.  But good luck people, just keep pushing y'all!

comment,COVID-19,neutral,I know people that have an exam the day after one of the breaks because the professors see it as a day off to study. I really wonder how some professors can be so out of touch and inconsiderate at times like these
comment,COVID-19,positive,Lmao this school really thought 2 mental wellness days would be the equivalent of a week's plus worth of spring br ak
comment,COVID-19,positive,We need a mental wellness week at least, and I‚Äôm not even joking. A month would be more suitable given how shit the past year has been, but then UMich would lose a lot of precious money so they wouldn‚Äôt do that
comment,COVID-19,positive,What are these mental wellness days you speak of?  I've only had 2 days of work since the semester started and I don't have another day off until March 20th.  Working 10 hour days 7 days a week living out of a hotel.  ME 675 is kicking my ass and I just realized mid terms are next week lol.  2 more months and I'm DONE, never again lol.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I originally wanted to do a math major, but now I‚Äôve decided that I want to get an engineering major, so I‚Äôm wondering how easy is it to transfer over to CoE, and when‚Äôs the earliest I can do it?  Thanks üôè
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I think you need to have at least one semester worth of grades before you can apply to transfer, so you won‚Äôt even be able to submit the transfer application until Winter 2022.  Earliest you‚Äôd be able to take classes as an engineering student would be Spring/Summer 2022 or Fall 2022.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Usually you have to have one or two semesters behind you to transfer. I recommend looking up the cross-campus transfer requirements and take those classes during your semester at LS&A.   Usually the classes are like Math 115 and 116, phy 140 and 141, the Gen chem sequence or organic I sequence, eecs 183, and like an English/FYWR course. Good luck!
comment,Prospective Student,negative,I wouldn't worry about it too much. First year of engineering and math can be similar. I would say figure out the engineering you want to do. For instance if you wanted to do chemical engineering you would  need to take chemistry.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[https://www.engin.umich.edu/admissions/undergrad/cross-campus-students/](https://www.engin.umich.edu/admissions/undergrad/cross-campus-students/)
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Just repeating what others have said, you probably won't be able to transfer right away but you'll be able to take all the prereqs that you need to transfer because most schools require some sort of prereqs to transfer.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I have a friend who was in LS&A and wanted to do CoE, but waited to transfer until he wanted to declare because CoE tuition is slightly higher than LS&A tuition. Just something to think about.

post,Health / Wellness,negative,Hi y'all! So as a junior I've finally found the courage and shed the anti-mental health brainwashing of my family to reach out and get help!  ... Only we're in the middle of a pandemic and it would seem that neuropsych evals are next to impossible to find right now (I think I might have ADHD and autism lying beneath my depression, panic attacks, social anxiety, ptsd, etc.). I'm seeing a psychiatric nurse right now who wanted to put my back on antidepressants, but I really don't think depression is my main issue and I'd rather get that worked out. She wants me to go to therapy as well, but ultimately I feel like therapy and seeing the psychiatric nurse will be a waste of my time and money if I can't get in for a proper diagnosis via the neuropsych eval. Like, yeah I'll be able to have some things addressed, but most of it won't be and the therapy and meds they want to give me might be for things I don't actually have.   So any thoughts or insight would be greatly welcomed, thank you üíôüíõ As well as if anyone knows of where I can get a neuropsych eval without having to wait a year or pay 3-5k for it.
comment,Health / Wellness,positive,Working on this as well; made calls just today, actually. U-M's wait is insane (a literal year, like you said; I couldn't believe it). St. Joe's said they're scheduling into August which is still long but a lot less, so you could schedule that for now and try and find something earlier? I am also going to talk to my insurance and see if I can get coverage for an out of network provider (if I can find one) because in no way is this a reasonable wait time so it is essentially the network is not adequate (so it would be a network adequacy appeal, basically).  So, in short, following this myself to see if anyone knows anything, and also will update if I hear any additional info.  Also I should mention that psychiatric services and therapy should both be completely free to you through UHS and CAPS respectively. Medication obviously isn't free but it otherwise shouldn't cost you a dime to at least try therapy and psychiatric care.
post,Housing,positive,I signed a lease in the fall not knowing I was going to rush, but now I have joined a sorority and have been told I must live in the house. I am supposed to find a way to get out of my lease, but I don‚Äôt know how. Also, I would rather live in an apartment than the sorority house, so can my sorority actually force me to live in, or is it just highly recommended? Any advise would be great.
comment,Housing,positive,They can definitely refuse to initiate you if you don‚Äôt sign a housing agreement. A lot of people don‚Äôt really want to live in the house, but everyone wants the big house and private meeting spaces to exist...so you have to take turns paying for it.   The finances associated with Greek life are no joke. Once you‚Äôre initiated, if you don‚Äôt pay your dues (or you attempt to quit mid-semester without an approved reason), national organizations can and will take you to collections.
comment,Housing,positive,>or is it just highly recommended?  Impossible for us to know unless you give the name of the sorority. You're better off asking them directly.
comment,Housing,neutral,I don't know about this specific sorority, but for mine, there's just a one year live in requirement that you can do any year you want, but if you absolutely can't live in they can't force you to. Tbh it's a little weird for them to be telling you you must live in next year, especially since rush is in the winter and everybody signs leases for the next year in the fall. My sorority has been telling new members not to worry if they already signed a lease for next year, and they can just live in their junior year. I would just talk to whichever VP is in charge of logistics like that and explain the situation and see what they say, bc I can't imagine them not being accommodating for you.
comment,Housing,positive,You can also reach out to [student legal services](https://studentlegalservices.umich.edu/) if talking to the sorority isn't helpful. They may be able to help you break your initial lease, or clarify the legal obligations the sorority contract has actually imposed on you.
comment,Housing,positive,because of covid my sorority is a lot more willing to change rules for this year, you could say you‚Äôre concerned with covid as well bc we have no idea what it‚Äôs gonna be like in fall lol i also joined my sorority a couple weeks ago as a freshman
post,Class,neutral,I‚Äôm taking Econ 101 (sure, nothing too over the top for a beginning course), but my grade is hurting so much because of the policy that the econ department has in place. The policy has it for when taking exams/quizzes, you MUST answer a question before moving on, and you can‚Äôt revisit it once it‚Äôs answered. This is such an impairment on how I thoroughly complete my coursework and exams as I am the type of person to move on to questions if I don‚Äôt know them right away, let alone I like going back through and checking my answers before submitting it entirely. It‚Äôs especially frustrating when I answer a question by guessing but as soon as I hit next, I realize the correct answer. I know this is a departmental policy so I clearly can‚Äôt go to my gsi‚Äôs or instructor, but I‚Äôm not the only one feeling this way in my class. What options do we have in efforts of challenging this policy? How does this even reflect how exams would be taken in person? I would‚Äôve been able to go back to previous answers in person, so why is it that it‚Äôs online that it has to be different? I‚Äôm saddened to say that I really don‚Äôt see myself passing this class because of this, and if I do, it will be from pure luck.
comment,Class,negative,It‚Äôs graded on a curve though so it impacts everyone equally.  The real problem is that AP Econ doesn‚Äôt get you out of Econ 101. They literally use the same mf textbook, taught in the exact same way about the exact same material. So kids who‚Äôve already taken the whole class shift the curve higher than it should be

post,Buy / Sell,positive,Hi, this semester has not gotten off to a good start and I am falling behind in a couple of my courses. I talked with my professors and they suggested I try to find a tutor that can help me out. I have reached out to a couple people about tutoring and their rates seem really high, like $40-$50/hr. Is that normal at UM or should I see if they will lower their rate a bit? Most of them are graduate students, if that helps.
comment,Buy / Sell,neutral,For a grad student that‚Äôs normal. Think of what you are paying for, particularly if it‚Äôs a PhD student who already has a masters + GSI teaching experience.

post,Finances,positive,I'm looking to take EECS 280 this spring but I'm not sure that it's a good idea to just take just 1 course as far as financial aid goes.  Would it be cheaper to just add another course to get full-time financial aid?  For context I'm an OOS student in CS-ENG

post,Prospective Student,positive,I kinda want to know why you went out of state? I having a dilemma whether or not I should go cuz of tuition fees... I just want to see your reasons and if it‚Äôs the perfect fit for me as well
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Best school I got into, all my in-state options are way way lower ranked, and I'm lucky enough to be able to afford my cost of attendance without debt.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I grew up in a state where industry was more important than education. It was so bad that most academic classes at my high school focused on passing the different portions of the ACT exam (ACT math, ACT English/reading) rather than on higher education. My high school allowed for students to drop academics entirely and focus on trades like auto repair (nothing wrong with that also if that‚Äôs for you). The state colleges are good, don‚Äôt get me wrong but when I tried to transfer summer classes from one of the institutions, UM denied the credits because they didn‚Äôt have the same academic depth or challenge as their counterparts at UMich. Plus, there was a lack of knowledge being taught as those state institutions (ex. Nursing majors are not required to take any chem courses past Gen chem and only need one semester of anatomy and not two or equivalent). I‚Äòve always loved learning and being challenged in academics, but my home state wouldn‚Äôt have been able to provide that for me. So, I came here to UMich. I was also laughed at by other parents of my peers. It was always ‚Äúwhy go there? There are perfectly fine industry jobs and education here!‚Äù ‚ÄúBecome a show girl! You have the body and it pays well! You don‚Äôt need the knowledge.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you forcing your parents to pay so much for an education when you can get paid well here at work?‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I do feel bad about the cost even with financial aid and scholarships, but my parents agreed that if I wanted a good education, I needed to get out of my home state and find a school that would provide a challenge.
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Didn‚Äôt get into any similarly ranked schools in state, parents said not to worry about cost. I have 2 family members that went and had nothing but good things to say about it. Wouldn‚Äôt have gone if I had to take loans though.  If you want to calculate it, look at the average earnings of a cheaper school you got into and compare it to average earnings at umich minus the loan payments you‚Äôll have to make depending on the loan amount for each school (can look at average earnings per major through college scorecard or our own uni earnings report).  Obviously it‚Äôs not exactly indicative of your earnings and what your situation will be, but the gap in cost may not be all that worth it.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It was my number one choice from the beginning. My home life was a little strained so I wanted to get pretty far away from my parents so they didn't visit all the time. Also the best choice in state was where most people from my high school went and I didn't want to just do high school again. I wanted to go somewhere where I was forced to make new friends and really figure myself out without being held back by being around people that had known me for a long time.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Live in Alabama.   &#x200B;  Honestly could leave it at that, but wanted a better education than any universities in my state offers in STEM and better opportunities.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was deciding between UofM and UCSD (which is a 20 min drive away). I went with UofM because it was better for my major, the campus atmosphere felt much more upbeat when I visited, and also because I have lived in SD my whole life, so I wanted to get a change. I haven‚Äôt  been on campus yet but I can‚Äôt wait to and I‚Äôm confident I made the right decision
comment,Prospective Student,positive,In terms of tuition fees, lower loans are ideal but you can go up to your of salary of your firstjob . For example if your first job is on avg making 60k a year you could stomach 60k of loans. There is some wiggle room like 65k but i wouldn't go beyond that figure.  As to go or not depends on your situation. If you have a similarly ranked school available at a cheaper price I'd say go there. Michigan is a great school but people overstate it imo. That is to say peer institutions can have similar programs, opportunities etc...  If it's not a peer institution, then remember not coming for a peer institution doesn't kill your chances going anywhere. I did community college first then transfered. Saved a bit of coin.   Could you provide more details?
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I didn‚Äôt want a repeat of highschool with all of the same drama queens. Michigan is diverse and in a great town, these are the most integral years of your life and shaping yourself is important.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,My states in state tuition isn‚Äôt that good. In State at Michigan people spend like 10k or less, my states more like 25k  So my offer at Michigan ended up being less then being in state.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,go to the school w the lowest tuition and highest value. don‚Äôt just come here because of the prestige i can guarantee you it‚Äôs not worth $65ish grand. if you‚Äôre getting aid/scholarships then by all means go to michigan
comment,Prospective Student,positive,tbh i don't consider Umich a state school even though it technically is  kinda like how I don't consider Berkeley a state school... you just have to make a judgement call ig
comment,Prospective Student,negative,I should not have come here as the leadership is incompetent.  I would pick a school that guarantees a normal college experience.

post,Finances,neutral,
comment,Finances,positive,Not to be a wet blanket on all the outrage that flows from this graphic, but it's a good time to trot out my not-ready-for-TedX talk on Endowments.  A lot of us go through life without getting close enough to an endowment to have to know the ins and outs of how they work.    An endowment is a great resource, but it's not a checking account.  People react to these numbers as if Stanford has $26.4 billion it COULD be spending (but just refuses to because it sucks, is greedy, etc) just like UM has $11.9B it could spend if it were just less sucky and greedy.  That belief is great for ginning up anger but that's not quite right.   Endowments are legally structured so that they cannot be spent.   They're like a permanent investment account.  That's what donors stipulate when they give an endowment gift.  Institutions aren't supposed to spend that money.  What they can spend is some of the income that this money generates.  It's not peanuts!   When you invest $26B or $12B you're probably gonna get an investment return in the hundreds of millions.     So, does a big endowment provide lots of resources?  It sure does!  But just remember that the resources do not equal the value of the endowment.  They provide more like 4.5% or 5% of the endowment, depending on how the institution chooses to manage spending.  Here's the other limit: usually the donors specify what an endowed gift's income is for.  As a result, the institution isn't 100% free to spend the income on any problem, issue, need, or great idea it runs across.  In other words, it may get hundreds of millions of interest income to spend, but those dollars have to be allocated with so much towards kidney research, library collections, sustainability, financial aid, and so on.

post,Housing,positive,Hello! I was accepted into the Masters of Accouting program at Ross. I am about 95% confident of committing. I am looking to explore housing options near Ross preferably. I looked into grad housing provided by the university. I do prefer to live alone so Northwood I & II were the most attractive options to me for on-campus, but it is farther from Ross. Are there any suggestions for off-campus housing? And for those who have lived in Northwood, what are your thoughts? Any comments and suggestions are appreciated!
comment,Housing,negative,What's your budget?  Northwood is fine, but very difficult to get into. There are often long wait lists since grad students often stay there their entire tenure.  It will be difficult to find cheap, single housing near ross. There is some parking, but it can be expensive and fills up quickly during a normal school year. singles, start at 1300 (without utilities and unfurnished) but easily go into 1600-1800 territory.   &#x200B;  A lot of master students just live in north or south ann arbor where it's cheaper and go bus to campus.
comment,Housing,positive,you should check out the icc coops for baker graduate student coop! it‚Äôs a great way to get to know other grad students and also have meals and food ready for you to save time
comment,Housing,positive,Though you're not interested in living with others, I recommend you consider applying to [Munger](https://housing.umich.edu/residence-hall/munger/). It's a very short distance to Ross, it's cheap (relative to the other options), the apartments are actually very spacious, and I barely interacted with my housemates unless I wanted to. There's a gym upstairs, personal bathrooms in each bedroom plus a guest bathroom, in-unit washer/dryer and double everything in the kitchen (including 2 dishwashers). It was certainly easy for a year, and many of my grad school friends renewed their leases for the remainder of our program.

post,Student Organization,negative,I have rushed a handful of pre-professional fraternities and have been rejected by all of them. Am I the only one that thinks that there is a large amount of gate keeping with competitive clubs here? It seems a little ridiculous to me.
comment,Student Organization,positive,It‚Äôs their way of maximizing how rewarding their content and resources are, since people that do get accepted tend to be more committed and excited about their orgs. It‚Äôs not too different from how job applications are, except maybe more objectifying and less focused on skill? It sucks because there‚Äôs more of an emotional and time commitment, and it boils down to them judging you and whether they want to be friends with you or not.  The rush process is unfair for some disadvantaged groups. I.E. they‚Äôre are more likely to think you‚Äôre ‚Äúcool‚Äù if you‚Äôve had the money/time for nice things like traveling, sports, obscure hobbies, etc. It‚Äôs already hard for poor and not well-connected kids to fit in here, and frats widen the gap some more. Even ‚Äúcool‚Äù students with those things could get rejected randomly since that‚Äôs the nature of the process.  Just my opinion and that‚Äôs life in general. Michigan is large enough when there‚Äôs many open clubs too, and you could also start your own club maybe
comment,Student Organization,positive,Welcome to Michigan. Gate keeping and elitism is very common theme here.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Sounds like business frats, which are a bit of a crapshoot / honestly require some things to fall into place (luck)
comment,Student Organization,positive,I‚Äôm not sure if you are a male or Pre-Med but the Pre-Med frats clearly take more girls and they don‚Äôt even try to hide it. On their instagrams you can see their pledge classes with 4 boys each and like 15-20 girls. I think the fact that they are clearly trying to make them sororities and not even try to make the pledge classes fifty fifty is ridiculous to me.
comment,Student Organization,positive,Just had the same experience running the gamut of pre-law frats but no dice. Thought I‚Äôd have a decent chance given a fairly unique background but ig not. Luckily I think it‚Äôll have a net positive affect just out of the spite it fosters and the fact that things like that don‚Äôt really mean shit for grad admissions anyways lmao

comment,Class,positive,YouTube is great but it isn‚Äôt available in every country. And VPNs are sometimes unreliable.
comment,Class,positive,Your professor should currently be able to record all class sessions and have them automatically saved to canvas! It‚Äôs just a setting they can turn on and leads to making everything more accessible.
comment,Class,positive,Some professors want you to actually participate in the class. If some students rewind a bit, that means you can't ask questions at appropriate times and professors can't ask questions to the students.   If you're not synched with the professor, what's the point of doing the live session?  It makes sense for the very few who might just jump back a few seconds then jump back to live, but knowing my adhd brain, i'd be a full 5-10 min behind for the whole class and at that point, I should just be watching it as a recording since I can't ask/answer questions anymore   That said, I do attend my classes live, because otherwise I won't watch the class at all. What I end up doing is A) recording the fast moving lectures on my own and b) write notes on sticky notes and stick those in my notes with the assumed timestamps so I can go back and watch that part of the lecture later and fill in what I missed.  I've also tried treating things like a live class. It's tempting to say "oh it's recorded, I'll just go back and listen later" but in-person we might have just raised our hand and asked for clarification or for the prof to repeat if needed. It's okay to do that in a recording too (just not every 10 seconds).
comment,Class,negative,I don't disagree. Unfortunate you need 1k subs on YouTube for this.

post,Prospective Student,positive,Hi, I was admitted as a RC incoming freshman. Based on some research it seems that South Quad (Honors Housing) is a better place to live than East Quad (RC housing). But if I am in both Honors and RC, it seems I will be put in the East Quad (Which I have lived during my summer school and is already pretty nice).  It seems Honors is like: Honors Courses + Thesis, RC is like a residential stuff plus some foreign language requirement.   So is it encouraged to be in both programs? If I have to choose only one of them, RC or Honors?  Thanks
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Based on your post it really sounds like housing is weighing heavily into your decision, but I don't think it should unless cost is a factor (since you'll be required to dorm two years if you're in RC, and living outside if the dorms tends to be cheaper).  If it's really on your mind, I don't think South Quad is much better than East Quad if at all. I lived in South Quad but stayed briefly at East Quad during orientation and it was really nice. If I were to pick, I would actually prefer East Quad, but both are very good places to live and bigger dorms compared to some doubles on campus. I think maybe you see a lot about South Quad because it's more "accessible" than East Quad (in the sense that more students can apply to/get to live in South Quad compared to East Quad which is mostly RC students).
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I was only in Honors and lived in South Quad last year, and I can 't say enough how much I loved it. Yes, the rooms aren't as updated and maybe be a tad smaller, but the culture/dining hall/area of South Quad is much nicer. You'll also meet other Honors students AND athletes and students who got randomly placed there. I found East Quad to be a lot more quiet and not as college feeling. Also, if football and other sports are somewhat normal next year, South Quad is usually the pit stop before and after games for food/meeting up with friends so it's always super lively on basketball nights and football Saturday's. If the academic advantages of each don't weigh heavily towards one than the other in your mind, I would go with Honors.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Something to keep in mind: Many Honors students don't write theses, and many people who write theses were never in the Honors program. The two share a name but aren't related (also theses are done through the major, not through the Honors program).
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Might be biased (because I am in the RC), but I found that EQ was by far better than SQ, although, only went in to SQ a few times. I really just liked how quiet EQ was. Objectively it really makes no difference. Both have dining halls, both are new and not cramped.  &#x200B;  Also it should be noted that you can be an honors major but not be in honors, if that makes any difference to you. Both are good options and I know Honors/RC kids who were in SQ.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You can be in both Honors and RC, but you will be committing to a two-year residency in East Quad- at least, that's the way it was prior to COVID, who knows now?  If you're in RC, at least some of your classes will be in EQ. That may be a plus or a minus, depending on your point of view. EQ also has central air, but SQ does not.  Honors alone doesn't even require that you live on-campus; Honors Housing is distinct from the Honors program. You did well to get the choice- you should pick based on who you are and what you want to do in your college program.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Why are you choosing this based off of the housing locations? East Quad and South Quad are both pretty good, and you should join a special program because you're interested in the content it involves, rather than because it grants access to "better" housing.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,do the rc!! south quad doesn‚Äôt have air conditioning in the whole building, while east quad does <3 also in the winter months it‚Äôs so nice to just be able to go downstairs for class rather than tracking across campus (if classes are in person, that is)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you're concerned about housing I'd say east quad is a lot better than south. I lived in west which was really nice, but we didn't have our own dining hall. South quad has a nice dinning hall but the rooms are smaller and have no AC. As long as you aren't in markley or north you should be fine though
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I lived in East Quad freshman year and I personally truly think it's the best dorm on campus. The furniture is more modern in East than South Quad, the rooms are similar in size (and both on the larger end). Unless you happen to have a ton of classes in Angell/Mason, your commute isn't gonna be different since EQ is close to the East side of the diag and SQ is close to the West side of the diag. South Quad has a bigger dining hall but it also serves more students, and East Quad's dining hall usually isn't as crowded as SQ. They both are recently renovated buildings so they come with a ton of nice study spaces, music rooms, etc, you name it. EQ is closer to the Ugli (where a lot of people study), parties, and the whole S University/E University area which has a lot of cool cafes, restaurants etc. SQ is closer (but still a walk away) from downtown, and closer to the Union which is a nice building. EQ Has the Blu Cafe which at least in non covid times seemed to have both a better variety and better hours than SQ's cafe. SQ is closer to the IMSB (gym) but EQ is closer to the CCRB (another gym) and Palmer field (has a running track and is pretty) and the arb (big nature area). Those are all the differences that I can think of. They're both great dorms, and tbh I'd focus more on the differences between RC and Honors as programs but you do you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I wasn‚Äôt in the RC, but I took (and enjoyed) a few RC classes.   The RC has its own culture and vibe. The language immersion is super intense‚Äîit‚Äôs hugely rewarding to do language immersion but also very time-consuming. You‚Äôll find a lot of artistic/creative people in the RC; people who create their own plays, take interdisciplinary classes, that type of thing. RC students seem pretty close knit with each other and professors. It‚Äôs kind of like a small liberal arts college w/in U of M.   All of this is to say that RC and Honors are distinct programs. EQ and SQ are both very nice dorms. I would think about the type of environment you prefer over which dorm is better.

Here's the email we all got today, though.  https://preview.redd.it/j8v66a9uxch61.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=468abd006f43da6ec3a99fe13150693bdaf34114
comment,Class,negative,The assignment essentially compared underrepresentation of People of Color, women,  and LGBTQ+ communities in STEM to Lewis structures. The assignment came across to many students as tone deaf and not considering of systemic issues  (there is a piazza post discussing this).   The exact wording of the assignment was: ‚ÄúYour email should incorporate an analogy that connects the problem of the lack of diverse representation in STEM to the limitations of Lewis structures for representing resonance (to do this, it may be helpful to look back at how ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is described in each context)‚Äù
comment,Class,negative,GroupMe was going crazy earlier.
comment,Class,positive,Is this really surprising? The last few years the university has shown they A) don't really get it or B) they don't care,

post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I just learned that Henry Ford College doesn't offer their discrete class over the summer, which kinda screws up my summer plan. Is there any in-state community college that does offer it over the summer?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,If you go to the transfer credit site and put in EECS 203 it will let you check--but the dropdowns that come up don't seem to include any Michigan community colleges, alas.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,U of M Dearborn offers it over the summer. I took it when I went there and there were a bunch of kids from Ann Arbor taking it with me.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,Hey man similair position im planning on taking it at grcc
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,I know you can take it at Oakland University, so not really a community college, but it still is another option.
post,Miscellaneous,positive,Howdy all,   A friend and I are working on a photography project and we need to capture as many photos of the campus/AA skyline as possible. Preferably they would be locations that are high in elevation (eg, 9th floor Weiser) with a good view of the city.   If you have any suggestions they'd be appreciated!
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,If you go to Keech and Main by the Big House, the parking lot has really cool views of the campus. I use to park my car and sit on the roof and eat food during the summer. Really cool vibes at night.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,There‚Äôs a space at the top of the dentistry building that is tough to access, but I‚Äôve seen great photos from up there.   https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/2j73dl/campus_exploring/cl9u7fy/
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Top floor of munger  Top of a parking deck The bell towers in central or north (in normal times they have tours)
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,The roof of the parking deck at 4th and William near state street has a really good view of the stadium and campus
comment,Miscellaneous,neutral,There's a parking lot next to East Quad (like one block to the north and east) where you can go to the roof and it has decent views.
comment,Miscellaneous,positive,Try the 9th-10th floors of Hatcher- they're pretty quiet (there wasn't anyone there when I went up there pre-covid), and you have a really nice view of the campus, including the Big House in the distance. Go during sunset- the light is beautiful!
post,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,i have an exam from 8-11pm monday, does anyone know of study spaces that are open that late?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,While technically not "Study Spaces", pretty much every academic building on north campus is open to students and many have random quiet study spots that you can use.   Also on north campus, all the engineering classrooms are empty and available for you to use.

comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Yea me too, I can‚Äôt get in my friend account/Wolverine access for scholarships. I emailed the AO about it and she sent me a link to set an acc up which I already did :( some pages were down today too like dining and housing pages, what do we do? Do we just wait? I need to get in to apply for scholarships and see my FA:/
post,Class,negative,For all my EECS 203 peeps, how were you guys doing on the homework leading up to the midterm? I‚Äôve had some pretty bad grades on them recently and I‚Äôm kinda nervous about passing the class.
comment,Class,neutral,I remember from 203 that hw was a lot harder than exam questions because u have a week to do it, as long as you understand the correct answer ur chilling
comment,Class,negative,I did good on the first and awful on the second. Reminder you do get lowest three dropped.
comment,Class,positive,i have done terrible on the first two. way below the average. I think this 3rd one is the only one I think I will do good on because I got a ton of office hours help on it. We got this and u can dm me if you wanna fail together lol
comment,Class,positive,I've lost three points total so far. I assume that's pretty good but I haven't talked to anyone else about it. I completely f'd up HW 3 #7 though. So that's three more points gone at least.
comment,Class,negative,I‚Äôve been getting like 1 to 2 problems wrong per homework, so 80-90% each? I HATE when math classes grade hw work on correctness, but as long as you look at the answer keys and completely understand what you did wrong you should be ok. Homework is meant to help you understand, not make you an immediate pro. If your worried about exams, I would focus more on the practice exams they posted
post,Housing,negative,just a potential question because it‚Äôs 3am and i got worried:  I have an apartment on campus next year and I‚Äôm stressing about potentially taking a gap year. Unfortunately, whether or not I take a gap year depends on this program that won‚Äôt release results until July. Is it even possible to find people who are still looking for apartments then?  I‚Äôd be sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 other people, so 2 people per bedroom. The apartment is right next to the Diag/Utowers/CCTC.
comment,Housing,positive,Not to be the bringer of bad news, but  \- It's tricky to land someone who wants to sublet in general and it seems like the seller-side of the market always outpaces the demand pretty heavily, excluding this year after we got the everyone-evac-the-dorms situation  \- You for sure can't do it at 100% recompensation for the total rent, 'cus yeah, people will just go to one of the cheaper, more desperate people for a lower rate  \- When it's multiple people to **one** bedroom it gets about 90x worse. Most people aren't down to share a room with a rando after freshmen year dorming and privacy is a thing  Best of luck on the program admissions though\~
comment,Housing,negative,To add, its a toss up whether fall semester will be remote or not. Even if the vaccine reaches instate students by summer, most fall plans are made in the spring. Also there is precedent that fall could be remote because of out of state vaccine distribution. No one knows when out of staters will get theirs and it's irresponsible to move people back en masse just to get the vaccine.  With that said, the supply of housing will exceed demand and you will be competing with other subletters and rental companies in terms of prices and accommodations
comment,Housing,negative,This is the one year I wouldn't be too concerned. Many people I know who got screwed with leases signed before covid last year chose not to sign this year since next year is still unknown. I also haven't signed a lease for next year and will gamble on either subleasing or signing in the fall right before classes start. So I wouldn't be worried unless you have a high rise apartment that will be difficult to sublease. If you want, you can DM me and if next year is going to be normal ill be interested in subleasing for 8 months.
post,Prospective Student,negative,I didn't receive much aid and although it was expected, I'm so sad. I'm planning to become a UX designer so I'm expecting a starting salary of around $50k. Mid career salary seems closer to $100k. Is michigan worth the debt? My other option is UIUC and god I just really don't want to go there.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,This one is tough honestly. UM-AA will give you an advantage as a UX Designer, but not as much as say if you were in CS. But 80K is a lot of money. I honestly think it depends on how much you dislike UIUC. Another option would be two years of UIUC and than transfer to UM. honestly - 80K is a lot of fucking money, if UIUC is free, go there. If it‚Äôs under say a 30K difference, that‚Äôs where I would consider UMAA.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Not worth it. Go to uiuc
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Go to UIUC for a year or two and if you really hate it, reapply as a transfer. Could potentially halve your debt
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I used to go to UIUC > got booted > went to community college > applied to UMich > accepted my offer > damn covid gotta ruin everything > sad I‚Äôm paying so much for online classes   I‚Äôd say save your money bc classes are going to be online at UMich for next fall+winter with how things are going and UIUC has a lot more freedom to take in-person classes... Unless zoom university is your thing
comment,Prospective Student,negative,If you want to go into UX,  go to UIUC to start and then do a transfer student app to UMSI's BSI program. Also if you change your mind about what you want to do it won't hurt you to stay in Illinois.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You can always transfer.  UIUC is a great school.  You will be taking the same caliber intro courses at UM so why go into debt?  Look at what you would take first year for courses and see how they transfer.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Gamble on Biden administration long-term education cost policies? I wouldn't. That's a lot of money
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Nope. 80k debt vs 50k salary, I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs not something you wanna do.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Other than UIUC being in a cornfield it will provide you comparable job opportunities and salary.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Prospective Student,positive,This one is really rough :( I'll give my two cents but obviously, I don't know your full situation so I could be wrong. Debt is really hard to handle and that 80k figure is a bit misleading due to how much interest you'll incur. Also consider how that will affect your lifestyle; maybe you can't buy a car or be a homeowner because you're paying $800 a month for your loans. I'm not sure where else you are planning on going for school, but if UIUC will be free, I would definitely do that. UMich is a great school, but so is UIUC and you'll do great there! Try to negotiate with UMich, pointing out how UIUC is tuition-free and maybe you can work something out.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Can't tell you what to do, but can say that the starting salaries for UX designers who graduate from the School of Information's Bachelor's in Information program (the "BSI" for short) have a starting salary higher than 50k! Here's the link to the most recent employment report. Keep in mind though that this include all 3 of the BSI's tracks together (Information Analysis, UX, and Social Media), so it's not specific to just UX, but could give you a better picture of outcomes. [https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/umsi\_bsi\_employment\_report\_2020.pdf](https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/umsi_bsi_employment_report_2020.pdf)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Does it make fiscal sense? No. At most your total loans should be 1 year of salary of your first job.    That said, you're free to go here if you really want to. Nothing is stopping you.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Go to UIUC, imo. If you want to go further after undergrad in UX, School of Information has a Master‚Äôs program that would be good
comment,Prospective Student,positive,No because if 80k is just your tuition you‚Äôll acquire other expenses from living and all.  But have you considered UIC? You‚Äôd still cheap Illinois tuition but you‚Äôd be in a major city. You‚Äôd have better connections and opportunities for interning during the school year compared to UIUC
comment,Prospective Student,positive,yeah bro 80k is a lot of dough and UM is cool n all but not 80k cook ... you‚Äôre going to be amazing in whatever you do regardless of school, don‚Äôt fall for the clout trap
comment,Prospective Student,negative,You could always work your ass off and pay for it as you go and starve like I did for five years, getting no sleep and working hundred hour weeks studying and earning enough to pay for school. Or you could go to a work study college where it‚Äôs free to go but you‚Äôre required to work X amount of hours a week. College of the Ozarks comes to mind, which is the 5th most difficult college in America to get admitted you right behind Columbia U.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,If undergrad debt will be more than expected starting salary, not worth it.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Is it worth $80k of debt? Maybe, for some majors I'd say definitely. Is it worth $80k of debt *more* than UIUC? No. Basically you're going to have to ask yourself if you're willing to pay $80k to live in a nicer place for 4 years.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,80k is going to be more like a 100k after interest over the lifetime of a loan. My advice would be to go to UIUC.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,No
comment,Prospective Student,negative,Fuck it, Go Blue!!!
post,Finances,neutral,
comment,Finances,positive,As many believe a state college should, Michigan highly prioritizes in-state students for financial aid. They also generally favors freshmen over transfer student.   So, no, they‚Äôre not super generous with OOS students.
comment,Finances,neutral,I pay $0. In fact the school pays me $600 a semester. Gotta be older than 24 though
comment,Finances,neutral,It depends on a lot of factors and fin aid is not well understood.  I do know of some oos students who have a full rides or close to it (0 to 5k debt a year) others who get decent savings (5-15k) and others that get nothing.   Efc is not an accurate indicator by itself.  If you've already applied wait for your fin aid package. If not apply and see what you get.
comment,Finances,neutral,8500 a year is what I pay EFC 0, OOS, age 24 when I got in.

post,COVID-19,positive,Just curious
comment,COVID-19,positive,If you‚Äôre in a priority group, yes, undergraduates can get it through Michigan.   Undergrads in group 2 (no existing conditions, young, not in medical or essential work) will eventually be able to get them through Michigan.
comment,COVID-19,positive,I got mine through my work but a friend of mine did. She had zero symptoms for both vaccines. I got the moderna and didn‚Äôt have symptoms for the first one but the second one caused a whole host of things and kept me in bed for a day or two.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,I‚Äôm an undergrad and I think I‚Äôm considered essential bc I‚Äôm a lab worker, no updates on when I might get something, my PI who‚Äôs probably in his 60‚Äôs did just get his though

post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Hello everyone, I‚Äôm Tuan from another university in Vietnam. Your school has the course that allow students to make blimp and I want to make one blimp like that. I had found one syllabus and a past report. Do you guys have any more documents or materials that I can learn more details? Like there were an impressive report with detailed calculations, i wonder how did you guys can do that. Thank you.
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,Okay so... I‚Äôm a former instructor for that lab, and I‚Äôd share our documentation, but honestly the equations are a rough estimate at best - most of the time the numbers are nowhere close to correct (there are just so many differences between the impressive calculations and the reality of building a blimp). Aerodynamics calculations were practically useless, because the blimps just move so slowly. The hardest parts are programming the Arduino (there are probably better resources online for that) and getting access to large quantities of helium. The blimp itself was made from plastic painter‚Äôs drop cloth, balsa wood, hot glue, and fishing line - we just went through materials so quickly that we didn‚Äôt use anything expensive or sophisticated. But it did the job!  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I absolutely loved taking that class, and teaching the lab was a highlight of grad school for me! (Sorry to all the students I roasted as a GSI...) But ultimately the class was more about systems engineering than anything else, and our calculations were actually a lot less impressive than they seem. If you have a syllabus and a report, that‚Äôs honestly probably a good start for trial and error!  Edit: can confirm this is ENGR 100-700
comment,Academics - Other Topics,neutral,What class is it?
post,Class,positive,Hi, I'm a second sem freshman premed student thinking of doing an MCDB major w an economics minor. I need to take Econ 102, Stats 250, Physics 135+136, Physics 235+236, Chem 210+211, Chem 215+216, all before I declare my major.   My premed advisor says that taking a courseload like Chem 210, Stats 250, Econ 102, and physics would be bad for my GPA and make me paralyzed to do anything else, but I don't know how to complete all of them unless I take classes over spring or summer.  So, do you recommend taking spring/summer classes for Econ 102, Stats 250, etc? I don't want to take any lab based courses over spring/summer.
comment,Class,positive,I would recommend against a minor. It adds course work but doesn't add any value post graduation. If an employer wants an economist they will just hire an economist. If you want to get skills in that field it would be better to get experience in that area via project.   To answer your question it's possible bit keep in mind some courses are compressed so your classes will be longer hours. So you may get burned out since things will be on zoom
comment,Class,positive,I would recommend doing any gen eds you can at a community college and transferring in  They‚Äôll be cheaper to take and often the curriculum is easier
