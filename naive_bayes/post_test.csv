comment,Class,negative,I took classes one summer and regretted not having a break the next fall, but YMMV.
comment,Class,positive,Keep in mind, as you are weighing options,  that there are summer terms that are HALF terms (Spring Term, and Summer Term) and there's a summer term that is a normal full term (Spring/Summer Term).    &#x200B;  Why this matters?  It means that if you only enrolled in one half-term, you would still have a summer break, just a shorter one.  It also matters because in the half-terms, classes only meet for 7 weeks so they may meet more often (i.e. daily) or for longer.  Some students like that, others don't--and some classes may be easier or harder in that structure.  You may learn/retain more when you're hitting the material every day--but you have little turnaround time for homework assignments.     Not a lot of undergrads take Spring/Summer (the whole term) so I assume there are limited offerings.  I don't know if that's driven by low demand (few students want to sign away their whole summer) or low supply (not so many faculty want to sign away their whole summer) or some combo.  Anyway, people who DO want to have a super productive summer in terms of credits could take classes in both half terms.    &#x200B;  (apologies if you already know all this -- might be helpful for others)
comment,Class,positive,Don’t do so much. I’ve taken different classes in the summer and generally they are a lot of work. The material is a lot more condensed so it takes twice as much time per day than usual. I think stats 250 is good for spring/summer. Not sure I can recommend chem 210/211 for the shorter semester tho. I think you’ll gain value from a more normal pace. Orgo takes time to fully under and appreciate the methodology so I think it’s better to do those during normal semesters. Idk anything about Econ
comment,Class,positive,One thing about pre-reqs in the biology department, I’m planning on declaring MCDB as well and I spoke to an advisor who said that if you’ve completed the intro bio sequence (BIO 171, 172, and 173) and at least started the organic chemistry sequence (CHEM 210/211 and 215/216) then they’ll allow you to declare and then complete the other pre-reqs before graduation
comment,Class,positive,I didn't find econ 102 or stats 250 that difficult, personally, but you may find otherwise. I'm not in the natural sciences, so I don't know about the rest.  Out of interest, what did you take this semester/last semester? Distribution credits?   I don't think it would be a bad idea to take two of those courses in either the spring term or summer term, although I recommend taking at least part of the summer off (so not doing both of the half-terms). Doing fall, winter, spring/summer, fall, and winter terms before getting a significant break seems really rough.
post,COVID-19,neutral,
comment,COVID-19,positive,Not doubting that students make up a large percentage of total cases, but could part of this be that the university's testing infrastructure is catching cases at a significantly higher rate than the infrastructure most residents have access to?  My friends and I can get tested essentially whenever we want. All it takes is spending 5 minutes in a university building spitting into a tube. It is so incredibly convenient and easy, and I'd bet this is resulting in a lot of asymptomatic cases being caught that otherwise might go unnoticed. I imagine it just isn't this easy for everyone else to get tested, but maybe I'm wrong?
comment,COVID-19,positive,So about the percent of the city that’s in the um community - maybe less? Not surprising
post,Class,positive,For anyone who has taken Math 463, BioInfo 463, or BioPhys 463 (they're all the same course): how necessary is the advisory prereq of linear algebra? I emailed the professor but never got a response, and I was looking at taking it in the fall. I did really well in diffeq, which is also an advisory prereq, but I just wanted to see if I really need the base in linear algebra before signing up for that class.
comment,Class,positive,I used to run the lab for 463 years back so the curriculum may have changed since then, but at the time Linear Algebra was not required. You'll get into phase planes, eigenvalues/vectors (including building and solving Jacobian matrices), and some introduction to bifurcations but if you understand those concepts at a high level already you should be in good shape.  Linear Algebra is listed as a recommended prereq for many 400 level math classes but I actually finished my Math Bio major without ever taking it (though missing that class made for a rude awakening in some of the other more proof-based 400 and 500 level courses).
comment,Class,positive,I took Math 463, there were definitely some concepts of linear algebra that would be difficult to get by without in the first half of the course, but in the second half you would be fine. Was your DiffEq class purely DiffEq, or did you cover some linear algebra?
post,Class,negative,Hi everyone, I am trying to decide which class to take over the summer and would ideally like to take the one that is considered more difficult/time-consuming so I can focus solely on that class and take it online. From your guy's experience, which one was more difficult? (Mcdb 310 v. BIO 305)  Note: Pre- PA BHS major and I kind of hate math and chem (hated chem 210) so I'm scared of biochem  Thanks!!
comment,Class,neutral,Bio305 fersure
comment,Class,positive,I took both in summer. I feel like personally I preferred biochem to genetics just because I don’t like math 😂 and genetics had more math / calculations
comment,Class,positive,I took genetics last summer and biochem last fall (so both were online). I'd recommend taking genetics in the summer.  I think genetics is usually easier in the summer compared to the school year (there are more non-exam points available during the summer term, like homework/projects/daily quizzes). I didn't really enjoy it though--having dense 2-hour lecture videos Mon/Tues/Weds plus 3 zoom discussions a week felt like a drag. Probability and statistics are the only math in genetics (think Hardy-Weinberg and Punnett Squares).  Biochem wasn't my favorite subject either, but it's definitely way more bio-heavy than chem. It's like Bio 172 with more content. You usually won't have to cover mechanisms, and you won't need any of the reagents or reaction types taught in orgo. Instead, you'll be learning lots of enzyme names and functions. If you can, try waiting until things are in-person to take it--although it's memorization-heavy and you can control-f things while it's online, the online exams are designed to be open-book with lots of select-all-that-apply questions.
comment,Class,neutral,I'm currently is mcdb 310 and there is very minimal orgo knowledge required and the math basically doesn't go further than the stuff in gen chem
post,New Student,positive,I’m not meeting any friend and did not get a bid anywhere. I feel like I don’t belong here.  I’m really lonely.
comment,New Student,positive,We're in the middle of a pandemic so you definitely have to cut yourself some slack. With fewer students on campus, there's fewer chances to interact with others. Making friends is hard right now, but not impossible. Remember, things *will* get better and you're not alone. College students all around the country are socially isolated and dealing with loneliness as well.  My advice? Since people are remote learning, try making virtual connections. GroupMe for your classes or the sub's Discord server are a good place to start. Message a classmate on Zoom. The friend mode on Bumble is worth checking out too. The truth is, to make friends during the pandemic you have to be willing to put yourself out there a lot more.
comment,New Student,positive,never related to anything more, I’m considering transferring out of mich. if you feel like talking, pm me!
comment,New Student,positive,What are you interested in? Join every club that looks fun to you!
comment,New Student,neutral,I don’t think clubs are meeting
comment,New Student,neutral,Did you just transfer?
comment,New Student,negative,Yo I'm a sophomore, I had an incredible freshman year, and yet this is one of the loneliest times of my life. This is the crucial part: this isn't gonna be indicative of your overall, post-pandemic Michigan experience. Also, almost at any university you're probably gonna have a similar experience right now. It's just a tough time for everyone.
comment,New Student,positive,Loneliness is its own pandemic now!  It really, truly is.  Maybe UM isn't right for you (who knows) but you are not alone in feeling lonely. That's probably slim comfort.  Whether you end up transferring or not, you still need to get through the next few months here.  You will feel better if you make SOME connections.  So please give some activities a try where you can meet some people.  Yes, there are remote activities.  See the advice of others here, and also check out resources from Student Life and elsewhere--units are trying to stand up more things where people can meet remotely.
comment,New Student,neutral,No bid from any Greek houses?
post,Prospective Student,positive,I applied to Umich for RD and got the email a lot of deferred students got for EA. Does this also mean I got deferred or does this not mean anything because I'm RD?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  This form serves as your singular expression of continued interest in the University of Michigan and can be used to share additional information about yourself with us.  It is voluntary and is not required for us to consider your application in our Regular Decision process.  If there is additional information you would like to provide to us, please submit this form by February 20.  Please note: Given the high volume of applicants to the University of Michigan, this form is the only source of additional application information that will be considered. Therefore, additional information/communications sent outside of this form will not be added to your application.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,My guess is it’s a way for them to get ahead of stuff and already know if you’re still interested. For example maybe since you applied you found out you got in ED to another school and have committed there. So it gives Michigan one fewer application to worry about.    It would be obvious if you had gotten a formal decision, this does not seem like it.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,So basically the school is trying to make some cuts. This last application cycle had more applicants than previous cycles. Not just for undergrad but across the board.   This isnt the school saying no to you perse, they are likely looking for people to pull out to save bandwidth on the other apps.  I would fill the form out if you can or try to get something new. If you don't do anything, some admission people take silence as you're not interested to continue. And may reject you.
post,Finances,negative,Hi friends. The end of 2020 was very hard on me; a close friend died, I was robbed, in an unsafe living situation- a mess. A hot, stinky, dumpster mess.   My mental health hit a low, and being in a new city with no friends really made me feel isolated. Maize and Blue Cupboard helped me a ton during that time and I'm finally in a position where I can help those around me too. I know that cleanliness/access to meals can become a major point of stress and shame for those in financial need.   I hope this is allowed, but I wanted to offer **6** $50 grocery trips to any students in serious need right now. If you're comfortable, you can send me a list and I can get the items and bring them to you.   I guess the only way to do this is first come first serve with pms- I'll return to edit this as closed if I reach 6 students.   Underhoused-living and financial insecurity is really lonely and painful. And I'm hoping this is a way to reach someone in my position a few months ago.
comment,Finances,positive,This is incredibly kind and generous of you. So glad to hear that your mental health has improved so much.  For anybody that has a few dollars to spare, consider [donating to the Maize and Blue Cupboard](https://leadersandbest.umich.edu/find/#!/give/basket/fund/333660). It clearly can make a huge difference in student’s lives.
comment,Finances,positive,You're awesome. Good on you. Hope some people get what they need.
comment,Finances,positive,We need more people like you. I’m glad you pushed through that rough patch and I hope you can help other people through theirs as well :)
comment,Finances,positive,This is very kind, and I appreciate your efforts!  Good for you.
post,Academics - Other Topics,positive,I need couple of these to stay full time and not sure where to browse them. There seems to be no such option in lsa course guide?
comment,Academics - Other Topics,positive,If you just search up like all the mini courses or 1-2 credit courses it’ll generate all the courses available. It’s only like a couple pages and they’re divided by topics so you can just go to a topic that interests you and see if there’s a course scheduled for the second half of the semester. It’s not too bad tbh.
post,Class,neutral,Does anyone have any Youtube channels/videos they recommend for learning how to do the problems for Physics 135 quizzes? I don't find the lectures helpful but I need some way to bridge the gap between my understanding of the content and being able to actually solve the practice problems.
comment,Class,positive,Flipping physics is soo good. It saved my life when I took physics in high school. I’m currently in physics 135 rn and it helps a lot.
comment,Class,positive,Crash course is a classic: their physics series was great for cramming right before an exam

post,Prospective Student,neutral,Hi, So I was wondering if there were any scholarships I can do for umich for out of state applicants. I can’t seem to find anything related for it.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,Umich doesn't do scholarships. You might tuition assistance if you have financial need, but I wouldn't bank on that. fin aid is wonky for oos students.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Michigan awards like 10 merit scholarships a year, max. You're better off with external scholarships, or demonstrating financial need.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Most scholarships for freshmen will be awarded automatically, you don't have to do a separate scholarship.  And yes, not a lot of merit aid is awarded.
post,Prospective Student,positive,I plan on attending the college of engineering at Michigan this fall, majoring in Environmental Engineering. I did very well in high school, but I have to admit I could coast through my classes easily with no real studying etc. I am a very outgoing person and I really enjoy partying etc. I want to join a frat, but literally everywhere I read says that engineering at Michigan takes up all of your time and you can’t really do any of the social stuff which If true is going to really bother me. Is this really true? I really want to be able to do social stuff but also do well in environmental engineering. Is this realistic? Thanks!
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You absolutely can do both, don’t let it dissuade you. You may not have as much free time as some other majors, but it’s not all encompassing.
comment,Prospective Student,neutral,I know many men in social frats that are also in engineering. You should be just fine! Warning though, pledging takes a lot of time when you first enter Greek Life, from what I’ve heard.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,Engineering here is tough for sure and you'll need to get used to actually studying lol, but you'll be fine. First semester freshman year was kinda a slap in the face for me but I've adjusted to the workload and have learned to balance my academics/social life
comment,Prospective Student,positive,It depends on the individual, the number of credits you are taking, and how many labs or programming classes you have. I placed out of a lot of freshman classes and first semester hit me pretty hard. I'd say go for it but manage your time well.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You def can, if you're concerned about workload/time, engineering def takes up a lot of time (not sure about environmental though)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,I’m in IOE.  A good chunk of my fraternity is CS.  You can definitely do both.
comment,Prospective Student,positive,You could join triangle which is geared toward engineering and stem
comment,Prospective Student,positive,If you did well in high school while coasting, you will likely find engineering @ UMich to be fairly easy with a reasonable amount of effort.
post,Employment,positive,I'll be a graduate student this fall. I was wondering if anyone had advice or personal stories about getting a job in the area, what (or what not) to consider, balancing school and work, or anything similar. Just trying to prepare myself for what'll be my life this August. Thank you!
comment,Employment,positive,Advice significantly varies based on your field of study, pacing towards your degree and other factors, what kind of job you have (part time or full time etc..)     For instance I got my masters on the way to my phd in a year in engineering. I don't recommend it. And this when I focused solely on school. If I had a job, I probably would have failed.   It would really help if you gave us some more details.
post,Housing,negative,Hi guys, I was wondering if there is some off-campus housing that you recommend since I might go to AA in Fall 2021. Or is there any off-campus housing that you think is extremely bad? I will avoid those if you tell me. :) Thank you!
comment,Housing,positive,This "[Being Not-Rich at UofM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ou-AelCrAg6soUJVbiviKAGBGF276w-UBlw-eMigwOA/edit)" guide has some reviews of landlords in the area.

post,Degree,positive,How important are the essays for Ross Minor acceptance?  Have strong grades, good club/leadership  but struggling with the essays.
comment,Degree,positive,Definitely give it your all on the essays. Try to come up with some unique way that you’ll combine a minor in business with your major/other career aspirations.   I had a 3.5 GPA (C+ in MATH 115 and a W in another class) and still got accepted, likely due to my essays.
post,Buy / Sell,positive,Hey guys, it's me again haha. Please refer to my last post for some background:  https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/lf36yg/need_tutor_for_chem_210/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  Since I had success finding a tutor for Chem 210 I was hoping to also pick up a weekly tutor for Physics 140 and Math 115. Due to my work schedule, I need to find a tutor that would be flexible to meet within my time constraints, 1-on-1, and Ideally at a mutually agreed upon location for in-person sessions.  I could reasonably spend 30 bucks per session, but is negotiable depending on your background and how much help you offer. Grad students and current/former SLC tutors are welcome!  Ideally we would meet once a week for an hour at a time. The structure of our time spent together would be purely to answer questions I have about the material and help me develop study guides for myself.  If this is of interest to you, please send me a short note expressing your interest and your background via DM!
comment,Buy / Sell,neutral,Hey I’m a highly experienced tutor for math and physics! I’ll PM you
comment,Buy / Sell,positive,Hey there. So we are a company whose literally only purpose is to prep students for Math 115 exams at U of M. (I know, sounds crazy.). We’re having a free live online mini-review (yeah, free. no catch.) this Sunday, 2/14 @ 12:00PM. Check out our site and message there with any questions. Hope you can make it.   Also, we have a full digital study program for ALL of math 115. The whole course package costs less than 3 hours of private tutoring. And we think our content is the 💣. Check out our reviews. They speak for themselves.

post,COVID-19,neutral,
comment,COVID-19,positive,Overall this is a good thing. This is the first mass-vaccination campaign in history with equity as a first-class principle. That is a very hard problem and necessarily means you will reallocate supply as you bring online additional resources to reach underserved populations (for example, ramping up volunteers to run clinics in poor neighborhoods).  Also, since we are all wondering “when will I get offered the vaccine?”, I’d note this has nothing to do with overall supply, which is still ramping up. These day-to-day headlines on supply and demand do not accurately illustrate the fundamentals that have remained unchanged since December - we will have *at least* 200 million doses in the US by end of March and *at least* 400 million by June. It’s very likely the primary problem of vaccine distribution will become demand rather than supply in the next 2-3 months.  Edit: wow, multiple downvotes in the first 10 minutes! I’d appreciate if someone could tell me why. Do y’all really think the best way to ensure equity for vaccine access is to make vulnerable people in Detroit and Flint drive an hour to U-M Hospital rather than bringing the supply to them? Or do you doubt that Pfizer and Moderna are going to fulfill their federal contracts? [Pfizer is actually running ahead of schedule](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/02/02/covid-vaccine-pfizer-plans-to-deliver-200-million-doses-to-us-by-may-sooner-than-expected.html) and [here’s an editorial by a former FDA commissioner](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-do-when-theres-a-covid-19-vaccine-glut-11612732696?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/tTVQ5qfiz9) making the point that supply is going to improve soon and so we need to be preparing for a demand problem *now*.
comment,COVID-19,neutral,After reading the article, this doesn't affect students as much as the headline wants you to believe.   Basically, the total number of vaccinations hasn't been reduced, but previously UM medicine was the primary source of distribution, meaning that everyone who wanted to get the vaccine had to come to UM medicine.      With this new allocation method, the vaccine is being decentralized to more local areas. Instead of the people coming for the vaccine, the vaccine is coming to them, which is much better from a health perspective and an accessibility standpoint. Many people can't take the time to drive to Ann arbor to get a vaccine, or they may not have access to a car.      On top of that, it's restructuring the vaccine schedule somewhat. While covid is disproportionately affecting elderly people, it's also disproportionally affecting poorer people. The more vulnerable populations should get the vaccine sooner, as they are at higher risk of infection and morbidity.      From a student perspective, this has very little impact on us because we were last in line anyway.      But with current production and Pfizer trying to [reduce vaccine production time](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pfizer-hopes-cut-vaccine-manufacturing-time-almost-half-n1257069) it is likely everyone will get vaccines ahead of current projections.

comment,Housing,neutral,Due to covid Residence Halls are currently closed to guests (ie people not living or working in the actual building) so you cannot utilize the music rooms even if they are open (right now they are closed due to covid).
comment,Housing,negative,It kinda varies. There's some like Markley under physical lock-and-key so you have to go up to the front office desk with your MCard to borrow the key, so those ones not really. Meanwhile Stockwell doesn't lock the doors to the music rooms but the building MCard lock itself isn't going to let you in if you don't live there and it's an absolute dick move to use one of the two rooms as a non-resident. East Quad has like 3 or 4 in the basement that are accessible in non-residence / public space but you generally need to MCard in and I *think* that those ones are restricted to EQ residents, but I popped in a few times when people left them unlocked.
comment,Housing,positive,Yes, as long as you know someone from the dorm who can unlock them.  Some dorms like MoJo even have grand in the common rooms that anyone can play.  I’m not sure what’s the policy on that during COVID though.

post,COVID-19,positive,I'm not sure if it's just me, but I often find myself driting off and not feeling as engaged compared to an in-person setting. Especially in clubs and classes, I find myself like this.   Last semester I found myself more excited because I was just happy to be a wolverine (transfer student). Now that I completed my first semester, I just feel meh.   Do you guys have any tips or tricks for my problem?  Thank you in advance for any feedback and advice!
comment,COVID-19,positive,For me the best way to focus is to do something mindless with my hands like crocheting or drawing or just scribbling doodles. It keeps my brain active and keeps me entertained enough that I don't get distracted on my phone or something.  With all of the classes being recorded I dont even try to take notes during class. I go back through them and take notes later at my own pace.  I also have a specific place I sit to watch lectures that I dont sit at for anything else really. If you have that option its pretty helpful.

post,Class,positive,I am a freshman in 281 right now and I am very struggling. I can do the labs pretty fine but the projects are simply too much for me so far. I have no motivation nor any idea on how to do them. since I have a lot of time. Should I just drop 281 right now and replace with some mini courses to fulfill other requirements and take it again in person next semester?
comment,Class,neutral,What did you get on the first project? I think you should tough it out and aim for a P since there is covid grading
comment,Class,positive,You can do pretty bad on projects and still past the course. Though developing the intuition about how to go about coding projects (in general, but also in school) is important, I'd say the material is more important. Are you struggling to understand why one would pick X container over Y? Or what the time complexity of a snip it of code is? If you are able to understand the material, and the situations that call for certain things, then you should stay in. Given you are doing well on the labs, it seems like you do. You have time to develop coding intuition. But here's some tips that may help with project:   Read the spec in full and take notes while you read it. Watch the project video. Discuss (not code, but ideas) with peers. Go to proffice hours to ask questions.  You got this!
comment,Class,positive,Sounds like a tough spot. I assume it's required for your major? If you withdraw from / drop the course, what can you do to improve your chances of success the next time you take it?  I think you need to talk to the instructors and/or an EECS advisor.
comment,Class,neutral,Office hours!!!!!!!!!!!!
comment,Class,positive,You have until the last day of classes this semester (April 21) to withdraw from the course and it NOT be on your official transcript (https://lsa.umich.edu/advising/policies-procedures/fall-2020-student-guide.html). Honestly, I would withdraw. You’re a freshman taking 281, a notoriously difficult class for a lot of students. Take it another time. You’ll be fine.

post,Class,positive,May be a bit early to ask, but I'm considering taking Astro 201 next semester. Presently I'm taking MATH 116 and Physics 240. I'm curious about how difficult/rigorous the mathematics will be compared to the calc classes. Would I be ready if I successfully complete 116 and 240? Is any coding knowledge required?   Planning to major in Astrophysics by the way.
comment,Class,positive,You'd be more than ready. I took ASTRO201 first semester of freshman year with only hs calc and physics. Most of the math you'll be doing is algebraic and given the necessary equations for the homework.
comment,Class,positive,Hi! I’m taking Astro 201 right now and so far we haven’t used any calculus except for one integral which I don’t remember off the top of my head but I know I could do it in my head at the time. For reference, I’m currently taking math 116 and physics 260. We honestly haven’t used much from physics 240/260 either, mostly things I learned in mechanics. Let me know if you have questions about the specifics of the course or what the workload is like and I’d be happy to help!
comment,Class,positive,It’s a great class that u will honestly enjoy. It’s a class that is purely focused on learning. If you honestly like learning, the class will be one of the best classes u can take and does not compare to the level of UMich Calc classes. Don’t worry about it and just take it, you won’t regret it.
post,None,positive,I got an "Engineering Honors Special Invite" email today and was wondering if it means I have a good shot or anything legit. I'm well versed with "national honor society" emails that are pure bs. Is this "invite" basically sent to a bunch of random engr kids and then they weed out the suckers?
comment,None,positive,I got a few of those emails when I was a freshman and a sophomore, pretty sure it doesn’t really mean much, but it’s not a scam like a lot of the others are. Even if they are selective with it, you’re probably better off spending your time with something else.

comment,Food / Culture,positive,They were supposed to re-open on the 8th, so I hope they actually are. I haven't been there myself to confirm. Maybe drop a call and see?
comment,Food / Culture,neutral,They were closed this past Wednesday for some reason, but they've been open the rest of the week.
post,Food / Culture,positive,I have some downtime during weekends and since there's not much to do, I was thinking of volunteering at the Maize and Blue Cupboard to get some non-clinical volunteering hours in. Has anyone ever volunteered there? If so, what did you do and how was your experience?     Thanks in advance for any insight.
comment,Food / Culture,positive,I did last semester! I just washed baskets for customers while they were coming in/out, and labeled items for a couple hours. Super easy and  laidback, usually they don’t have too much to do. I recommend going with a friend for company.
post,Prospective Student,positive, Umich sent me an email saying **How to Communicate Your Continued Interest in the University of Michigan** but also said **We are certain we have enough information at this time to make a decision** in the same email. What does this even mean? does every applicant get this email? (btw i applied rd)
comment,Prospective Student,positive,My understanding is that:  1) They have everything they need for a decision right now, but;  2) They want you to confirm that Umich is still your first choice, and you will be attending should you be accepted.  This is a time-saving thing for them. It's basically an unofficial guarantee for them that the people they accept will go to their school instead of another institution. If people communicate they are no longer interested (e.g., they were accepted to their preferred school), then they won't waste anymore time on that application. By contrast, if someone says they *are* still interested in attending, that will be weighed in against people who may not have replied.  Go through their provided outlet and let them know you have continued interest and that Umich is your first choice.

comment,Prospective Student,positive,It sounds to me like you either didn't finish your application or haven't committed to attending in some way that they have asked you to.
post,Housing,positive,Could anyone recommend places to live during the fall 2021 semester as a junior international exchange student? (party friendly places please)
comment,Housing,neutral,there is a facebook group [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/223351171575348/?multi_permalinks=849574745619651) for subletting and leasing apartments/houses primarily for umich students. Most of the stuff I see on there is people trying to sublet their place for a few months or a semester, you shold check it out.
comment,Housing,positive,Depending on which country you are coming from, if there are sufficiently many students from your country and they have a student org on campus you can mail them to see if someone is willing to host you. Usually international student communities stick together and there is always someone from the organization willing to help
comment,Housing,positive,party friendly and exchange student sounds like a perfect fit at truth co-op!! the website is www.icc.coop, and they have a youtube video here that gives a tour, https://youtu.be/UHIWAgJOsXA  truth is themed for international students but is normally a 50/50 of umich student and international/exchange students. it’s big enough to find a calm atmosphere but also have a lot of people around if you wanna talk to them! I believe they do fall only contracts as well :)
post,Media,neutral,
comment,Media,neutral,I was at the commencement. The security was crazy.  The Secret Service was on all the highway over passes. There were snipers up above the luxury boxes. They put dump trucks around the stadium as a barricade. Obama looked like an ant from way up in my seats. I guess it was him at least.
comment,Media,neutral,now show the line for the dining halls during the first week of classes last semester
comment,Media,positive,I was there booya! Got bronchitis from sleeping in those cold streets but it was worth it!
comment,Media,neutral,I stood in that line!
comment,Media,positive,Looks like the line for popeyes
comment,Media,positive,This was not for Obama speaking at commencement in 2010.  [This line is for when Obama spoke on campus in 2012](https://www.michiganradio.org/post/ann-arbor-thousands-wait-line-tickets-see-obama).  For reference Obama @ commencement  wasn't announced until April of that year; you can very clearly see this is the winter.  [Here's the Ann Arbor news with images from that date](http://www.annarbor.com/news/the-line-for-graduation-tickets/); you can see grass and green in the background.  There's no way this is in April in Michigan.
comment,Media,neutral,I remember going to this
comment,Media,neutral,\*CORRECTION\* This was the line for when Obama gave a speech on campus April 2, 2014.   I misremembered the event.
comment,Media,positive,Did graduating students still get the regular amount of tickets for family and friends?
comment,Media,positive,This is too creepy that this got recommended to me, my dad has been talking about how it's cool that Tom Brady, the best ever, came from uofm, alert I guess
comment,Media,positive,I went to that graduation but didn't have to wait in line! A friend was graduating that year and she gave me and another friend two tickets. I graduated the year before and Larry Page was our speaker.
comment,Media,neutral,[deleted]
comment,Media,negative,I had tickets and didn't go.  Didn't want to show up hours early so I could get a terrible view of a televised speech. Though i didn't watch it on TV either.
